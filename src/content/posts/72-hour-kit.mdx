# 72-Hour Emergency Kit: Complete Checklist and Guide

A 72-hour kit contains everything you need to survive for three days if you're forced to evacuate your home. It's the foundation of emergency preparedness—ready to grab and go when disaster strikes.

Whether you call it a 72-hour kit, go-bag, or emergency evacuation kit, the concept is the same: pre-packed supplies that sustain your family until you reach safety or help arrives.

## Why 72 Hours?

The 72-hour timeframe comes from emergency management research:

- **First responders** typically establish aid stations within 72 hours
- **Evacuation routes** usually clear within 3 days
- **Utility restoration** often begins within this window
- **Shelter availability** increases after initial chaos

<Callout type="info">
72 hours is a minimum. Extended disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics) can last weeks. Build your 72-hour kit first, then expand to 2-week and 30-day supplies at home.
</Callout>

## 72-Hour Kit vs. Bug Out Bag

These terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences:

| Feature | 72-Hour Kit | Bug Out Bag |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Duration | 3 days | 3+ days, potentially longer |
| Focus | Evacuation to shelter | Self-reliance in wilderness |
| Weight | Can be heavier | Weight-optimized |
| Skills needed | Basic | More survival knowledge |
| Contains | Comfort items, documents | Survival tools, bushcraft gear |

**For most families:** Build a 72-hour kit. It covers the most likely scenarios (hurricanes, fires, chemical spills) where you're evacuating to a shelter, hotel, or relatives' home.

## The 72-Hour Kit Checklist

Organize your kit by category. Check off items as you acquire them.

### Water (Most Critical)

<Checklist

  items={[
    { item: "Water (1 gallon per person per day = 3 gallons each)", priority: "essential" },
    { item: "Water filter or purification method", priority: "essential", productSlug: "sawyer-squeeze" },
    { item: "Purification tablets (backup)", priority: "recommended", productSlug: "aquatabs-water-purification" },
    { item: "Collapsible water container", priority: "recommended" }
  ]}
/>

**Options for water:**

## Building Your Kit: Step by Step

### Step 1: Choose Your Container

| Container Type | Pros | Cons |
|----------------|------|------|
| Backpack | Portable, hands-free | Limited space |
| Duffel bag | More space, easy packing | Awkward to carry far |
| Wheeled luggage | Easy transport, maximum space | Not good on rough terrain |
| Plastic tote | Cheap, waterproof, stackable | Must be carried |

**Recommendation:** One backpack per adult (35-50L), supplemented by a duffel or tote for family supplies.

### Step 2: Pack in Layers

1. **Bottom:** Heavy items, things you'll need last
2. **Middle:** Clothing, shelter, bulky items
3. **Top:** Frequently accessed items (food, water, first aid)
4. **Pockets:** Critical items (documents, phone, wallet, flashlight)

### Step 3: Make It Grabbable

Your kit should be:
- **Packed and ready** — Not "I know where everything is"
- **In an accessible location** — Not buried in storage
- **Known to all family members** — Everyone knows where it is
- **Regularly checked** — Batteries fresh, food unexpired

## Family-Specific Considerations

### Infants and Toddlers
- Formula and bottles
- Diapers and wipes (many)
- Baby food
- Favorite comfort items
- Child medications
- Portable crib/playpen (if evacuating by car)

### School-Age Children
- Familiar snacks they'll actually eat
- Small toys, books, or games
- Comfort item
- Copy of custody documents if relevant
- School emergency contact info

### Elderly Family Members
- Extra medication supply
- Mobility aids
- Medical equipment (CPAP, oxygen—plan power needs)
- Large-print emergency info
- Hearing aid batteries

### Pets
- 3+ days of food and water
- Collapsible bowls
- Leash, collar with ID tag
- Carrier or crate
- Pet first aid
- Vaccination records
- Photo for identification

## Storage and Maintenance

### Where to Store Your Kit

- **Near an exit** — Garage, front closet, mudroom
- **One per car** — Modified kit in each vehicle
- **Work/school** — Smaller kits at frequent locations

### Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Check batteries | Every 3 months |
| Rotate food | Annually |
| Rotate water | Every 6-12 months |
| Update medications | Monthly |
| Review documents | Annually |
| Test flashlight/radio | Every 3 months |
| Update clothing (size/season) | Twice yearly |

<Callout type="tip">
Set calendar reminders for maintenance. Many people build excellent kits, then discover dead batteries or expired food when they actually need it.
</Callout>

## Quick Start: Budget 72-Hour Kit

Build a basic kit for under $100:

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Backpack (used or budget) | $20 |
| 3 gallons bottled water | $5 |
| Emergency food bars (3600 cal) | $10 |

| Emergency blanket (2) | $5 |
| Whistle | $3 |
| Documents (copies) | $5 |

Upgrade over time: better first aid, quality water filter, power bank, emergency radio.

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How heavy should my 72-hour kit be?",
      answer: "A comfortable carrying weight is 15-25% of your body weight. For most adults, aim for 15-30 lbs. Heavier is okay if you're evacuating by car, but assume you may need to walk."
    },
    {
      question: "Should each family member have their own kit?",
      answer: "Each adult and older child should have a personal backpack with basics (water, food, clothing, flashlight). Shared items (first aid, tools, shelter) can be distributed or kept in a family duffel. This ensures essentials aren't separated."
    },
    {
      question: "What about weapons for self-defense?",
      answer: "A 72-hour evacuation kit focuses on reaching safety, not extended survival. If you choose to include protection, ensure it's legal in your area and all evacuation destinations (shelters often prohibit weapons). A sturdy flashlight serves defensive purposes without complications."
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from a bug out bag?",
      answer: "A 72-hour kit focuses on evacuation to established safety (shelters, hotels, family). A bug out bag assumes more self-reliance and wilderness survival. For most suburban families, a 72-hour kit covers realistic scenarios better. Wilderness survival gear can be added as skills develop."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I vacuum seal items?",
      answer: "Vacuum sealing extends food shelf life and compresses clothing, but makes items harder to access and repack. Consider vacuum sealing backup clothing and rarely-accessed items, but keep frequently used items in regular bags for easy access."
