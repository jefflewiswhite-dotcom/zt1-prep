# Best Survival Knives for Bug Out Bags and Emergencies

A quality knife is one of the most essential survival tools. It builds shelter, prepares food, creates fire, and handles countless tasks that would be impossible bare-handed.

This guide covers the best survival knives from budget to premium, plus what to look for when choosing your blade.

## Quick Picks

| Need | Recommendation | Price |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Best Value | Morakniv Companion | $15-20 |
| Best Overall | ESEE 4 | $130 |
| Heavy Duty | KA-BAR Becker BK2 | $90 |
| Premium | Benchmade Bushcrafter 162 | $200 |

## What Makes a Good Survival Knife?

**Essential features:**

- **Fixed blade** — More durable than folders for heavy use
- **Full tang** — Blade steel extends through the handle
- **4-6 inch blade** — Balance of versatility and control
- **Simple design** — Fewer failure points
- **High-quality steel** — Holds edge, resists corrosion

<Callout type="tip">
For survival purposes, a simple, reliable knife beats a complex "tactical" design. You want something that won't fail when you need it most.
</Callout>

### Blade Steel Types

| Steel Type | Pros | Cons | Examples |
|------------|------|------|----------|
| Carbon Steel | Easier to sharpen, sparks with ferro rod | Can rust, requires maintenance | 1095, 1075, 1080 |
| Stainless Steel | Corrosion resistant, low maintenance | Harder to sharpen, less tough | 440C, AUS-8, VG-10 |
| High-End Steel | Best of both worlds | Expensive, harder to field sharpen | S35VN, CPM-3V |

**For survival:** Carbon steel (1095, 1080) or tough stainless (AUS-8) are ideal. They sharpen easily in the field and handle abuse.

## Fixed Blade vs. Folding Knife

For survival purposes, **fixed blade is preferred**:

| Factor | Fixed Blade | Folding Knife |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Strength | Strongest | Lock can fail |
| Maintenance | Simple | Pivot needs care |
| Speed | Instant use | Must unfold |
| Batoning | Yes | Never |
| EDC legal | Sometimes restricted | Usually legal |
| Weight | Heavier | Lighter |

**Recommendation:** Carry a fixed blade in your bag and a folder for everyday tasks. The folder won't replace a fixed blade for serious survival work.

## Knife Care and Maintenance

### For Carbon Steel

1. **Dry after use** — Wipe blade immediately
2. **Oil periodically** — Mineral oil, gun oil, or dedicated knife oil
3. **Force a patina** — Helps prevent rust (mustard method)
4. **Store dry** — Don't leave in sheath long-term if wet

### For Stainless Steel

1. **Rinse after saltwater or acidic use**
2. **Light oiling extends life**
3. **Sharpen as needed** — More difficult than carbon

### Sharpening Basics

Carry a field sharpener in your bag:

- **Diamond rod** — Works on all steels, light and compact
- **Ceramic rod** — For touching up edges
- **Whetstone** — Best results, but heavier
- **Stropping** — Leather strop maintains razor edge

<Callout type="tip">
Learn to sharpen BEFORE you need to. A dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one—you'll apply more force and lose control. Practice at home.
</Callout>

## Survival Knife Uses

A good survival knife handles:

- **Shelter building** — Cutting cordage, shaping wood, batoning
- **Fire starting** — Striking ferro rod, making feather sticks
- **Food prep** — Processing game, cutting food
- **First aid** — Cutting bandages, making splints
- **Tool making** — Carving stakes, crafting tools
- **Self defense** — Last resort

## Budget Recommendations

**Under $25:**
- Morakniv Companion ($15-20) — Best value, period
- Morakniv Garberg ($70) — Full tang Mora (stretch budget)

**$50-100:**
- KA-BAR Becker BK2 ($90) — Heavy duty
- Ontario RAT-5 ($60) — Military proven
- Cold Steel SRK ($80) — Versatile design

**$100-200:**
- ESEE 4 ($130) — Best overall
- Fallkniven F1 ($150) — Swedish military
- Benchmade Bushcrafter ($200) — Premium

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is a bigger knife better for survival?",
      answer: "No. A 4-5 inch blade handles 95% of survival tasks. Larger knives (6-7\") are harder to control for fine work and add unnecessary weight. A moderate-sized fixed blade plus a folding knife covers all bases better than one huge knife."
    },
    {
      question: "Carbon steel or stainless for survival?",
      answer: "Carbon steel (1095, 1080) is preferred by many survivalists because it's easier to sharpen in the field and throws better sparks with a ferro rod. However, it requires oiling to prevent rust. Stainless is more forgiving but harder to maintain in primitive conditions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use my survival knife for batoning?",
      answer: "Only full-tang fixed blades should be used for batoning. Never baton with a folder, partial-tang knife, or thin blade. The Morakniv Companion's rat-tail tang can handle light batoning, but purpose-built knives like the ESEE 4 or BK2 are safer choices."
    },
    {
      question: "What about a machete instead of a knife?",
      answer: "Machetes are excellent for clearing brush and processing large amounts of wood, but they're poor substitutes for a knife. They lack control for fine work, fire preparation, and food processing. Carry a knife as primary; add a machete if your environment warrants it."
    },
    {
      question: "Are expensive knives worth it?",
      answer: "A $15 Morakniv will accomplish most survival tasks just fine. Premium knives offer better steel, edge retention, fit/finish, and warranties. For occasional use, budget options are fine. For daily carry or professionals, quality pays off over time."
