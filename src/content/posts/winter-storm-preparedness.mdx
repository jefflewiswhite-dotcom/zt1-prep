# Winter Storm Preparedness: Complete Home Survival Guide

Winter storms can knock out power for days, freeze pipes, and make roads impassable. The difference between a minor inconvenience and a life-threatening emergency often comes down to preparation.

This guide covers everything you need to prepare your home for winter storms—from backup heating to emergency supplies.

## The Real Dangers of Winter Storms

Winter storms kill more people than hurricanes or tornadoes in most years. The primary risks:

- **Hypothermia** — Indoor temperatures drop fast without heat
- **Carbon monoxide poisoning** — Improper use of generators and heaters
- **House fires** — Alternative heating sources used unsafely
- **Frozen/burst pipes** — Causing massive water damage
- **Falls on ice** — Leading cause of winter storm injuries

<Callout type="warning" title="Carbon Monoxide Kills">
Never run a generator, grill, or propane heater indoors or in an attached garage. CO poisoning deaths spike during every major winter storm. Get battery-powered CO detectors for every level of your home.

## Backup Heating Options

When the power goes out in winter, heat is your top priority. Here are your main options:

### 1. Portable Propane Heaters (Indoor-Safe)

The most popular emergency heating option. Units like the Mr. Heater Buddy are designed for indoor use with oxygen depletion sensors.

**Pros:**
- No electricity needed
- Heats quickly
- Propane stores indefinitely
- Relatively affordable

**Cons:**
- Requires ventilation (crack a window)
- Must have CO detector
- Need propane supply on hand

<ProductCard slug="mr-heater-buddy" badge="Most Popular" />

**Fuel planning:** A 1-lb propane cylinder runs a Buddy heater on low for ~5 hours. Stock 10-20 cylinders minimum, or use a hose adapter with a 20-lb tank.

### 2. Generators

A generator can power your furnace, keeping your normal heating system running. This is the most comfortable option.

**Pros:**
- Powers your existing furnace
- Can run other essentials (fridge, lights)
- Most effective solution

**Cons:**
- MUST be run outdoors (CO risk)
- Requires gasoline storage
- Loud
- Expensive

<ProductCard slug="honda-eu2200i" badge="Quietest" />

**Sizing:** Most furnace blowers need 500-1000W to start. A 2000W inverter generator handles most furnaces plus basic essentials.

### 3. Portable Power Stations

Battery power stations can run electric space heaters for limited periods. Best as a supplement to other heating methods.

**Pros:**
- Silent operation
- Safe indoors
- No fuel storage
- Powers other devices

**Cons:**
- Limited runtime
- Electric heaters drain batteries fast
- Expensive for capacity needed

<ProductCard slug="jackery-explorer-1000" />

**Reality check:** A 1000Wh power station runs a 1500W space heater for about 40 minutes. They're better for running a furnace blower (200-500W) for several hours.

### 4. Wood Stoves and Fireplaces

If you have one, a wood stove or fireplace is the ultimate backup heat source.

**Pros:**
- No fuel supply chain
- Can cook on it
- Heats effectively
- Works indefinitely

**Cons:**
- Requires existing installation
- Need dry firewood supply
- Fire risk if used improperly

**If you have a fireplace:** Stock at least one cord of seasoned firewood before winter. Ensure your chimney has been inspected/cleaned within the past year.

## Room Isolation Strategy

You don't need to heat your whole house. Pick one room to keep warm:

1. **Choose a small, interior room** — Less heat loss through exterior walls
2. **Close all doors** — Seal off unused areas
3. **Hang blankets over windows** — Reduce heat loss
4. **Everyone sleeps in the same room** — Body heat helps
5. **Use sleeping bags** — Designed for cold, better than blankets
6. **Stay off the floor** — Cold air settles; use mattresses or cots

A family of four in a small room with a propane heater can stay comfortable even when it's 0°F outside.

## Preventing Frozen Pipes

Burst pipes cause more damage than most storms themselves. Prevent them:

### Before the Storm
- Know where your main water shutoff is
- Insulate exposed pipes (basement, attic, exterior walls)
- Install heat tape on vulnerable pipes
- Disconnect and drain outdoor hoses

### During a Power Outage
- Let faucets drip (moving water freezes slower)
- Open cabinet doors under sinks (lets warm air reach pipes)
- If you leave, shut off water and drain pipes

### If Pipes Freeze
1. Keep faucet open (pressure relief)
2. Apply gentle heat (hair dryer, heat lamp, space heater)
3. Never use open flame
4. If a pipe bursts, shut off main water immediately

<Callout type="tip">
The pipes most likely to freeze are in exterior walls, unheated basements, and attics. Know where yours are vulnerable before the storm hits.
</Callout>

## Generator Safety

Generators kill people every winter storm. Follow these rules without exception:

**Location:**
- Run ONLY outdoors, at least 20 feet from any window or door
- Never in garage, even with door open
- Point exhaust away from house

**Operation:**
- Let it cool before refueling (fire risk)
- Store fuel safely away from ignition sources
- Use heavy-duty outdoor extension cords
- Never plug into house outlets (backfeed danger)

**Capacity:**
- Calculate your essential load before you need it
- Furnace blower + fridge + some lights = 1500-2000W typical
- Don't overload the generator

## Food and Water During Winter Storms

### Water
- Store 1 gallon per person per day (minimum 3 days)
- Fill bathtub before storm for toilet flushing
- Melt snow if needed (needs to be clean; boil if unsure)

### Food
- Focus on foods requiring no cooking
- Peanut butter, crackers, canned goods, dried fruit
- If you have a way to heat water: instant oatmeal, soup, coffee
- Don't open freezer unnecessarily (stays cold 24-48 hours if full)

### Cooking Options (Without Power)
- Camp stove (outdoors or with extreme ventilation)
- Propane grill (NEVER indoors)
- Fondue pot with Sterno (limited use indoors okay)
- Fireplace (if you have one)

## Vehicle Preparedness

Your car is your backup shelter and escape route. Prepare it for winter:

- Full tank of gas before storms
- Winter emergency kit in trunk
- Jumper cables or jump starter
- Tire chains or traction mats
- Ice scraper and snow brush
- Blankets and hand warmers

[Complete Winter Car Preparedness Guide →](/guides/winter-car-preparedness/)

## Communication Plan

- Charge all devices before storm
- Have battery backup (power bank)
- Battery or crank radio for weather updates
- Check on neighbors, especially elderly
- Know how to text if calls don't go through

## After the Storm

- Check for damage before using furnace/water heater
- Let faucets run to check for burst pipes
- Clear snow from vents and exhaust pipes
- Don't overexert shoveling (heart attack risk)
- Report downed power lines (stay 35+ feet away)

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How long can a house stay warm without heat?",
      answer: "It depends on insulation and outside temperature. A well-insulated home might drop from 68°F to 50°F in 8-12 hours at 20°F outside. Poorly insulated homes can reach freezing temperatures within hours. This is why backup heating is essential."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I run a space heater on a power station?",
      answer: "Yes, but not for long. A 1500W space heater drains a 1000Wh power station in about 40 minutes. Power stations are better for running a furnace blower (200-500W) for several hours, not for running space heaters directly."
    },
    {
      question: "How much propane do I need for a winter storm?",
      answer: "For a Mr. Heater Buddy on low, one 1-lb cylinder lasts about 5 hours. For a 3-day outage running heat 12 hours/day, you'd need about 7-8 cylinders minimum. A 20-lb tank with an adapter is more economical for extended use."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe to use a propane heater indoors?",
      answer: "Indoor-rated propane heaters (like Mr. Heater Buddy) are designed for indoor use with safety features. However, you must have working CO detectors, provide some ventilation, and follow all manufacturer guidelines. Never use outdoor-only heaters or grills indoors."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the minimum temperature to prevent pipes from freezing?",
      answer: "Keep your home above 55°F to prevent pipe freezing in most cases. Pipes in exterior walls or unheated areas may need the thermostat set higher or additional protection like heat tape."
