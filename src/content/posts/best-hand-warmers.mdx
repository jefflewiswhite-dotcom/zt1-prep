## How Many Hand Warmers to Stock

<Callout type="tip">
Buy hand warmers in bulk from Amazon, Costco, or Sam's Club. A 40-pack of HotHands costs about $20—that's $0.50/pair. Don't wait until a storm to buy; stores sell out fast.

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Do hand warmers expire?",
      answer: "Yes, most disposable hand warmers have a 4-year shelf life. After that, they may still work but heat output decreases. Check dates and rotate your stock. Fuel-powered and rechargeable warmers don't expire but need maintenance."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I reuse disposable hand warmers?",
      answer: "No. Once the iron powder is fully oxidized, the chemical reaction is complete. Some people try to 'pause' them by sealing in a ziplock bag, but this rarely works well. They're designed for single use."
    },
    {
      question: "Are hand warmers safe in a sleeping bag?",
      answer: "Yes, but don't place directly against skin—keep them wrapped in a sock or between layers. Don't use more than 2-3 per sleeping bag, and position them at your feet or near your core, not by your face."
    },
    {
      question: "Which is better: disposable or rechargeable?",
      answer: "For emergency preparedness, disposables are better. They work without power, store for years, and are guaranteed to work when you need them. Rechargeable warmers are great for daily use but depend on charging—problematic in extended outages."
    },
    {
      question: "Can hand warmers cause burns?",
      answer: "Yes, if placed directly against skin for extended periods. The average temperature (130-135°F) can cause low-temperature burns over time. Always use a layer of fabric between the warmer and skin, and don't sleep directly on them."
