# Best Fire Starters for Bug Out Bags (Top 10)

Fire provides warmth, water purification, cooking, signaling, and psychological comfort. In a survival situation, the ability to reliably start fire can be life-saving. Your [bug out bag](/guides/bug-out-bag) should contain multiple ways to make fire.

Here are our top picks and the fire-starting strategy we recommend.

## The Fire-Starting Rule of Three

Carry **three different methods** to start fire:

1. **Primary:** Bic lighter (easiest, fastest)
2. **Secondary:** Ferro rod (works wet, infinite shelf life)
3. **Tertiary:** Stormproof matches or backup lighter

This redundancy ensures you can make fire even if one or two methods fail.

## Quick Picks

| Category | Best Pick | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Lighter | Bic + Exotac fireSLEEVE | Reliable, waterproof protection |
| Ferro Rod | Light My Fire Swedish FireSteel | Proven, long-lasting |
| Matches | UCO Stormproof | Truly waterproof, burn in wind |
| Tinder | Wetfire Cubes | Works when wet, easy to use |
| Complete Kit | Überleben Zünden | All-in-one quality option |

## Detailed Reviews

### Best Lighter Setup: Bic + Exotac fireSLEEVE

<ProductCard slug="exotac-firesleeve" badge="Top Pick" />

A standard Bic lighter is the easiest, fastest fire starter available—but it can fail when wet or empty. The Exotac fireSLEEVE transforms it into proper survival gear.

**Why this combo wins:**
- Bic lighters are incredibly reliable
- fireSLEEVE makes it waterproof
- O-ring sealed for submersion
- Adds grip and durability
- Lanyard attachment for security

**The setup:** Bic lighter (~$2) + fireSLEEVE (~$12) = $14 for a near-foolproof fire solution.

<Callout type="tip">
Carry two Bic lighters—one in the fireSLEEVE as primary, one as naked backup. They're cheap and light.

### Best Ferro Rod: Light My Fire Swedish FireSteel 2.0

<ProductCard slug="light-my-fire-ferro-rod" badge="Best Backup" />

When lighters fail (wet, empty, broken), a ferro rod ignites regardless of conditions. It requires practice but offers virtually unlimited shelf life.

**Why we like it:**
- Works when soaking wet
- 12,000+ strikes (lasts years)
- 3,000°F spark temperature
- No fuel to leak or evaporate
- Works at any altitude

**Considerations:**
- Requires dry tinder to catch sparks
- Takes practice to master
- Slower than a lighter
- Need to scrape off black coating initially

**Best for:** Backup fire starting, wet conditions, long-term preparedness

---

### Best Stormproof Matches: UCO Stormproof

When conditions are truly terrible—wind, rain, cold—UCO Stormproof matches burn reliably.

**Why we like it:**
- Burn up to 15 seconds
- Work in wind and rain
- Can relight after being submerged
- Come in waterproof container
- Great backup option

**Considerations:**
- Limited quantity (25-50 per container)
- One-time use per match
- Bulkier than other options

**Best for:** Severe weather backup, signaling, getting tinder lit in bad conditions

---

### Best Tinder: Wetfire Cubes

Your fire starter is only as good as your tinder. Wetfire cubes ignite even when wet and burn long enough to get kindling going.

**Why we like it:**
- Lights when wet
- Burns 3+ minutes
- Non-toxic, odorless
- Easy to ignite with spark or flame
- Long shelf life

**Alternatives:** Cotton balls with petroleum jelly (DIY, effective), fatwood sticks (natural, reliable), dryer lint in film canister (free, works great).

## Fire Starting Kits

| Kit Contents | Weight | Cost | Best For |
|--------------|--------|------|----------|
| 2 Bics + 1 ferro rod + tinder | ~4 oz | ~$25 | Most BOBs |
| 1 Bic + ferro + matches + tinder | ~5 oz | ~$35 | Maximum redundancy |
| Premium kit (Überleben, etc.) | ~3 oz | ~$50+ | Quality-focused |

## Our Recommended Kit

**For most bug out bags:**

1. Bic lighter in Exotac fireSLEEVE (primary)
2. Light My Fire Swedish FireSteel (backup)
3. Wetfire cubes or cotton balls w/ petroleum jelly (tinder)
4. Small amount of fatwood (kindling)

**Total weight:** ~4-5 oz
**Total cost:** ~$30-40

This kit gives you fire-starting capability in virtually any conditions with enough redundancy to handle failures.

<Callout type="warning">
Practice before you need it! Starting a fire with a ferro rod takes skill. Practice in your backyard before you depend on it in an emergency.

## Ferro Rod vs. Lighter: Which Is Better?

| Factor | Bic Lighter | Ferro Rod |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Ease of use | Easiest | Requires practice |
| Speed | Instant | 30 sec - several min |
| Wet conditions | Can fail | Works great |
| Cold conditions | Harder to light | Works well |
| Fuel dependency | Limited fuel | Unlimited |
| Shelf life | 5-10 years | Indefinite |
| Best role | Primary | Backup |

**Verdict:** Carry both. Use the lighter when it works, fall back to ferro rod when it doesn't.

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How long does a Bic lighter last?",
      answer: "A standard Bic provides about 3,000 lights and can last years in storage. Even half-full lighters found in junk drawers work fine. They're cheap—carry two."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I really need a ferro rod if I have a lighter?",
      answer: "Yes. Lighters can fail (wet, empty, cracked) and you need backup. A ferro rod weighs an ounce and works indefinitely. It's cheap insurance."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best way to learn ferro rod technique?",
      answer: "Practice in your backyard. Scrape off the black coating, hold the rod near tinder, and scrape toward (not away from) the tinder. YouTube has excellent tutorials."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I start a fire with a battery and steel wool?",
      answer: "Yes, but this is a last-resort technique. It requires specific materials and is harder than using proper fire starters. Stick with the basics."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I include a magnifying glass?",
      answer: "Only if you have space. Magnifying glasses work but require bright sunlight—exactly when you're least likely to need fire urgently. Nice to have, not essential."
