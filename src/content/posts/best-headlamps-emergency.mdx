# Best Headlamps for Emergency Preparedness

A headlamp is one of the most practical emergency lighting tools you can own. Unlike flashlights, headlamps keep your hands free for tasks—cooking, first aid, repairs, navigation, or carrying supplies. In an emergency, that hands-free capability is invaluable.

We've tested the best headlamps for emergency preparedness, focusing on reliability, runtime, and practical features.

## Quick Picks

| Need | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Best Overall | Petzl Actik Core |
| Best Value | Black Diamond Spot 400 |
| Ultralight | Nitecore NU25 |
| Budget Pick | Energizer Vision HD+ |

## What to Look For

**Key features for emergency headlamps:**

- **Runtime** — Minimum 20+ hours on low; longer is better for extended outages
- **Brightness** — 200-400 lumens is plenty; more isn't always better
- **Red light mode** — Preserves night vision, doesn't attract attention
- **Battery type** — Rechargeable (USB), AAA, or hybrid for flexibility
- **Water resistance** — IPX4 minimum for rain protection
- **Comfort** — Lightweight with adjustable strap for extended wear

<Callout type="tip">
Lumens don't tell the whole story. A well-designed 200-lumen headlamp with good beam pattern often outperforms a cheap 500-lumen model with harsh, uneven light.

## Top Emergency Headlamps

### Petzl Actik Core — Best Overall

<ProductCard slug="petzl-actik-core" badge="Top Pick" />

**Specs:**

- **Runtime:** 130 hours (low), 2 hours (max)
- **Battery:** Rechargeable Core battery or 3x AAA
- **Weight:** 3.0 oz (with Core battery)

## Comparison Table

| Headlamp | Price | Lumens | Runtime | Battery | Weight | Waterproof | Best For |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|---------|--------|------------|----------|
| Petzl Actik Core | $70 | 450 | 130 hrs | Hybrid | 3.0 oz | IPX4 | Best overall |
| Black Diamond Spot | $50 | 400 | 200 hrs | AAA | 2.9 oz | IPX8 | Best value |

## Headlamp vs. Flashlight

For emergency preparedness, headlamps offer distinct advantages:

| Factor | Headlamp | Flashlight |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Hands-free | Yes | No |
| Task work | Excellent | Limited |
| Runtime | Often longer | Varies |
| Weight | Lighter | Heavier |
| Bright spot | Good | Excellent |
| Throw distance | Moderate | Often better |

**Recommendation:** Carry both. Use the headlamp for tasks and camp work, the flashlight for security and distance. They serve different purposes.

## Battery Strategy

### Rechargeable (USB)

**Pros:**
- No battery stockpile needed
- Charge from power bank, car, solar
- Lower long-term cost

**Cons:**
- Dead when depleted
- Degradation over years
- Charging takes time

### AAA Batteries

**Pros:**
- Instant "refuel" with fresh batteries
- Available everywhere
- 10+ year shelf life (lithium)

**Cons:**
- Battery stockpile needed
- Ongoing cost
- More weight for spares

### Hybrid (Best of Both)

Headlamps like the Petzl Actik Core accept both rechargeable packs AND AAA batteries. This gives you the convenience of USB charging with the reliability of battery backup.

<Callout type="info">
**Best approach:** Choose a hybrid headlamp when possible. Charge via USB normally, but keep AAA batteries stored as backup for extended emergencies.
</Callout>

## How Many Headlamps Do You Need?

**Minimum:** 1 per person in the household

**Better:**
- 1 per bug out bag
- 1-2 for home emergency kit
- 1 per vehicle

For a family of four, consider 4-6 headlamps total, with at least one high-quality unit (Petzl, Black Diamond) and budget units (Energizer) for backup.

## Maintenance Tips

1. **Test monthly** — Quick function check during other prep maintenance
2. **Remove batteries for storage** — Prevents corrosion if not using for months
3. **Keep lens clean** — Dirty lens reduces output significantly
4. **Store charged at 50-80%** — For rechargeable models
5. **Keep spare batteries with headlamp** — In a small bag or rubber-banded together

## Budget Recommendations

**Under $25:**
- Energizer Vision HD+ ($18) — Best budget option
- Coast FL13 ($20) — Good alternative

**$40-70:**
- Nitecore NU25 ($40) — Ultralight rechargeable
- Black Diamond Spot 400 ($50) — Best value
- Petzl Actik Core ($70) — Best overall

**Premium ($80+):**
- Petzl Swift RL ($120) — Auto-adjusting brightness
- Fenix HM65R ($100) — Ultra-bright dual beam

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How many lumens do I need for emergencies?",
      answer: "200-400 lumens is ideal for most emergency tasks. Higher lumens drain batteries faster and can actually be too bright for close-up work. A headlamp with adjustable brightness lets you use low settings (10-50 lumens) for reading and camp tasks, saving the high output for when you need it."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is red light mode important?",
      answer: "Red light preserves your night vision. After using red light, your eyes stay adjusted to darkness—important for security awareness or moving through dark areas. Red light also doesn't attract attention from a distance like white light, and won't disturb others who are sleeping."
    },
    {
      question: "Rechargeable or battery-powered for emergencies?",
      answer: "Hybrid is best (accepts both). If forced to choose one: battery-powered for pure emergency use, rechargeable for dual-use (everyday + emergency). With a rechargeable, make sure you have a way to charge it in an outage (power bank, solar, car)."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do headlamp batteries last in storage?",
      answer: "Lithium AAA batteries last 10-15 years in storage. Alkaline AAAs last 5-7 years. Built-in rechargeable batteries should be charged every 3-6 months to prevent deep discharge damage. Always store batteries removed from the headlamp for long-term storage."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use my headlamp in the rain?",
      answer: "Check the IPX rating. IPX4 handles splashing from any direction (light rain). IPX7 survives brief submersion. IPX8 survives extended submersion. For emergency use, IPX4 is minimum; IPX7+ is better for wet climates or outdoor use."
