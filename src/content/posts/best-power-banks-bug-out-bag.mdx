# Best Power Banks for Bug Out Bags (Top 10)

Your phone is a survival tool—GPS, communication, information, flashlight, and more. When the grid is down, a power bank keeps your devices alive. For your [bug out bag](/guides/bug-out-bag), you need reliable backup power that balances capacity with weight.

Here are our top picks for BOB power banks.

## Quick Picks

| Rank | Product | Best For | Capacity | Weight | Price Range |
|------|---------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Anker PowerCore 10000 | Overall | 10,000mAh | 6.4 oz | $ |
| 2 | Goal Zero Venture 30 | Rugged | 7,800mAh | 9 oz | $$ |
| 3 | Nitecore NB10000 | Lightweight | 10,000mAh | 5.3 oz | $$ |
| 4 | Anker PowerCore 20000 | Capacity | 20,000mAh | 12.5 oz | $$ |
| 5 | BioLite Charge 40 PD | Fast Charging | 10,000mAh | 7.5 oz | $$ |

## How Much Capacity Do You Need?

Quick math for phone charging:

- Modern smartphones have ~3,000-4,500mAh batteries
- A 10,000mAh power bank provides 2-3 full charges
- A 20,000mAh power bank provides 4-5 full charges
- Actual output is ~60-70% of rated capacity (energy loss)

**For most 72-hour BOBs:** 10,000mAh is the sweet spot—enough for several charges without excessive weight.

<Callout type="info">
Capacity alone doesn't tell the whole story. Quality cells, efficient circuitry, and output wattage matter. A cheap 20,000mAh bank may perform worse than a quality 10,000mAh option.

## Detailed Reviews

### 1. Anker PowerCore 10000 — Best Overall

<ProductCard slug="anker-powercore-10000" badge="Top Pick" variant="featured" />

Anker has built a reputation for reliable, reasonably-priced power banks. The PowerCore 10000 is their most popular model for good reason.

**Why it wins:**
- Perfect capacity for 72-hour scenarios
- Very lightweight at 6.4 oz
- Compact size (credit card footprint)
- Quality cells and circuitry
- Affordable price point
- Wide compatibility

**Considerations:**
- Not waterproof
- No solar charging
- Single USB-A output
- Not rugged enough for extreme use

**Best for:** Most bug out bags, everyday carry, general preparedness

### 2. Goal Zero Venture 30 — Best Rugged Option

<ProductCard slug="goal-zero-venture-30" badge="Rugged Pick" />

When you need a power bank that can handle abuse, Goal Zero's Venture line delivers.

**Why we like it:**
- IP67 waterproof (submersible)
- Drop-proof design
- Built-in flashlight
- Daisy-chain with Goal Zero solar panels
- Dual USB output
- Lanyard attachment point

**Considerations:**
- Lower capacity for weight
- More expensive
- Larger than non-rugged options
- Heavier at 9 oz for 7,800mAh

**Best for:** Harsh conditions, outdoor-focused BOBs, pairing with solar

---

### 3. Nitecore NB10000 — Best Ultralight

For weight-conscious builds, the Nitecore NB10000 offers premium capacity at minimal weight.

**Why we like it:**
- Only 5.3 oz (lightest 10,000mAh option)
- Carbon fiber shell
- USB-C with Power Delivery (18W)
- Premium build quality
- Compact design

**Considerations:**
- Higher price for capacity
- Not rugged
- Limited port options
- May be harder to find

**Best for:** Ultralight BOBs, weight-conscious builds, tech-forward users

---

### 4. Anker PowerCore 20000 — Best Capacity

When you need maximum runtime and can handle the weight, the PowerCore 20000 delivers.

**Why we like it:**
- 20,000mAh = 4-5 phone charges
- Dual USB output (charge two devices)
- Reliable Anker quality
- Reasonable price for capacity
- Good for families (charge multiple phones)

**Considerations:**
- Heavy at 12.5 oz
- Larger size
- Takes longer to recharge
- May be overkill for 72-hour scenarios

**Best for:** Extended scenarios, family BOBs, vehicle kits where weight matters less

---

### 5. BioLite Charge 40 PD — Best Fast Charging

USB-C Power Delivery (PD) charges modern phones significantly faster than standard USB-A.

**Why we like it:**
- 18W Power Delivery output
- Fast recharging input
- Quality construction
- Compact for features
- Good balance of speed and capacity

**Considerations:**
- Premium pricing
- Requires USB-C cable
- Not waterproof
- Some phones don't support PD

**Best for:** USB-C users, those prioritizing charge speed, modern devices

## Solar Charging: Worth It?

Many preppers consider solar panels to recharge their power banks indefinitely.

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Charging speed | Slow—full day of sun for partial charge |
| Reliability | Weather dependent |
| Weight/bulk | Adds significant pack weight |
| Best use case | Base camp, vehicle kit, long-term scenarios |

**Our take:** For 72-hour BOBs, a well-charged power bank is more practical than solar. Solar makes sense for extended scenarios or as a supplemental charging method.

If you want solar, Goal Zero's Nomad panels pair well with their power banks.

<Callout type="tip">
Keep your power bank charged! A dead power bank is useless weight. Check and top off monthly. Consider keeping it in airplane mode until needed to preserve charge.

## Capacity vs. Weight Analysis

| Capacity | Typical Weight | Phone Charges | Best For |
|----------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| 5,000mAh | 4-5 oz | 1-1.5 | Ultralight, get home bags |
| 10,000mAh | 6-7 oz | 2-3 | Most BOBs (recommended) |
| 20,000mAh | 12-14 oz | 4-5 | Extended scenarios, families |
| 26,800mAh | 16-18 oz | 5-6+ | Vehicle kits, home backup |

**The sweet spot for most BOBs:** 10,000mAh offers the best balance of capacity and weight.

## What to Charge (Priority Order)

When power is limited, prioritize:

1. **Phone** — Communication, GPS, information
2. **Headlamp/flashlight** (if rechargeable) — Essential for night navigation
3. **Emergency radio** (if rechargeable) — Information gathering
4. **GPS device** (if separate) — Navigation backup

What NOT to waste power on: tablets, laptops, entertainment devices (unless they serve critical functions).

## Our Recommendations

### For Most Bug Out Bags
**Anker PowerCore 10000** — Best balance of capacity, weight, and reliability. Affordable enough to have one in every bag.

### For Harsh Conditions
**Goal Zero Venture 30** — Worth the weight penalty if your BOB will face water, drops, or rough handling.

### For Ultralight Builds
**Nitecore NB10000** — Same capacity as the Anker at nearly an ounce less. Premium price but minimal weight.

### For Families/Extended Scenarios
**Anker PowerCore 20000** — More capacity for charging multiple devices. Consider this for vehicle kits or if weight isn't a constraint.

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How long does a power bank hold its charge?",
      answer: "Quality power banks lose about 1-2% per month when not in use. A full charge should last 6+ months sitting idle. Check and top off quarterly for peace of mind."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I bring power banks on airplanes?",
      answer: "Yes, but in carry-on only (not checked baggage). TSA limits to 100Wh per battery, which includes most power banks up to about 27,000mAh. Check current regulations before flying."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I get a power bank with solar built-in?",
      answer: "Generally no. Built-in solar panels are too small to charge meaningfully. You're better off with a separate, larger solar panel that can charge your power bank efficiently."
    },
    {
      question: "USB-A or USB-C output?",
      answer: "USB-C with Power Delivery charges modern devices faster. If your phone supports it, USB-C is worth having. USB-A works with everything but charges slower."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a power bank if I have a hand-crank radio?",
      answer: "They serve different purposes. A hand-crank radio charges itself slowly for radio use. A power bank charges your phone (much larger battery) much faster. For phone charging, a power bank is far more practical."
