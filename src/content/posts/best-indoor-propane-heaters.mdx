# Best Indoor Propane Heaters for Emergency Heat

When the power goes out in winter, a portable propane heater can keep your family warm when nothing else works. Unlike generators that must run outside, indoor-rated propane heaters bring warmth directly into your living space.

This guide covers the safest and most effective propane heaters for emergency home heating.

## Quick Picks

| Need | Recommendation | BTU | Price Range |
|------|----------------|-----|-------------|
| **Best Overall** | Mr. Heater Big Buddy | 4,000-18,000 | $150-200 |
| **Best Compact** | Mr. Heater Buddy | 4,000-9,000 | $100-130 |
| **Most Portable** | Mr. Heater Little Buddy | 3,800 | $60-80 |
| **Best for Garages** | Dyna-Glo 60K BTU | 30,000-60,000 | $150-200 |

## Critical Safety Information

<Callout type="warning" title="Indoor Use Requirements">
Only use heaters specifically rated for indoor use. These heaters have Oxygen Depletion Sensors (ODS) that shut off the heater if oxygen levels drop. Outdoor-only heaters lack this safety feature and can kill you.
</Callout>

**Before using any propane heater indoors:**
1. Verify it's rated for indoor use (has ODS)
2. Install battery-powered CO detectors
3. Provide ventilation (crack a window 1 inch)
4. Keep away from combustibles (3 feet minimum)
5. Never leave unattended while sleeping
6. Have a fire extinguisher nearby

## How to Size a Propane Heater

**General rule:** 20-30 BTU per square foot

| Room Size | BTU Needed |
|-----------|------------|
| Small room (100 sq ft) | 2,000-3,000 BTU |
| Bedroom (150 sq ft) | 3,000-4,500 BTU |
| Living room (300 sq ft) | 6,000-9,000 BTU |
| Large room (500 sq ft) | 10,000-15,000 BTU |

**For emergency heating:** You don't need to heat your whole house. Focus on one small room. A 4,000-9,000 BTU heater handles most emergency scenarios.

## Fuel Planning

### 1-lb Cylinders

- **Best for:** Short outages, portability needed

### 20-lb Tank with Adapter Hose
- **Pros:** Much cheaper per BTU, longer runtime, less waste
- **Cons:** Heavier, needs adapter hose ($20-30)
- **Best for:** Extended outages, home base heating

**Runtime comparison (9,000 BTU setting):**

| Fuel Source | Runtime | Cost Per Hour |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| 1-lb cylinder | 2.5 hours | ~$1.50/hour |
| 20-lb tank | ~50 hours | ~$0.40/hour |

**Recommendation:** Stock 10-20 1-lb cylinders for flexibility, plus one or two 20-lb tanks with an adapter hose for extended use.

## Propane Storage Tips

- Store cylinders upright in a ventilated area
- Keep away from heat sources and direct sunlight
- Don't store in living spaces or basements
- Check for leaks periodically (soapy water test)
- Propane doesn't expire—stores indefinitely
- 20-lb tanks should be inspected every 10 years

<Callout type="tip">
During winter storm season, keep your 20-lb tank outdoors but accessible. Bring only 1-lb cylinders inside for immediate use. Cold propane still works but flows slower—let cold cylinders warm up for 30 minutes before connecting.
</Callout>

## Heater Maintenance

**Before each season:**
- Inspect burner and pilot for debris
- Check hose connections for cracks
- Test ODS by intentionally limiting airflow (heater should shut off)
- Clean exterior and control knobs
- Replace batteries in fan (Big Buddy)

**After each use:**
- Disconnect propane cylinder
- Store in dry location
- Protect from dust and debris

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I sleep with a propane heater on?",
      answer: "Not recommended. While indoor-rated heaters have safety features, it's best to heat your room before bed and turn off the heater while sleeping. Use quality sleeping bags to stay warm overnight, then reheat in the morning."
    },
    {
      question: "How much propane do I need for a 3-day outage?",
      answer: "Running a Buddy heater on low (4,000 BTU) for 12 hours/day uses about 2.5 1-lb cylinders per day, or 7-8 cylinders for 3 days. A 20-lb tank on the same schedule lasts about a week."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I really need to crack a window?",
      answer: "Yes. Even with ODS safety, propane combustion uses oxygen and produces some CO2 and water vapor. A 1-inch crack provides fresh air without significantly affecting heating efficiency. This is not optional."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use my propane heater in an RV?",
      answer: "Mr. Heater Buddy units are RV-rated when used with their RV accessories. However, always ensure proper ventilation and working CO detectors in the enclosed RV space."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between indoor and outdoor propane heaters?",
      answer: "Indoor heaters have Oxygen Depletion Sensors (ODS) that automatically shut off the heater if oxygen levels drop. Outdoor heaters lack this safety feature and produce more CO. Never use outdoor-only heaters inside—people die from this every winter."
