## Essential Items to Add

- Tourniquet (CAT or SOFTT-W)
- QuikClot or other hemostatic agent
- Israeli bandage or similar compression bandage
- Medical tape (multiple uses)

**Consider adding:**

- Emergency blanket
- Tweezers (quality ones)
- Moleskin for blisters

**Personal items:**
- EpiPen if allergic
- Inhaler if asthmatic
- Any daily medications
- Glasses/contacts backup

<Callout type="tip">
Vacuum-seal medications and rotate them annually. Heat, moisture, and age reduce medication effectiveness. Mark expiration dates clearly.

## Building vs. Buying

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| Pre-made kit | Convenient, organized, covers basics | Generic, may include unneeded items | Most people, starting point |
| Custom build | Tailored to your needs, quality control | Time-consuming, easy to forget items | Experienced users, specific needs |
| Hybrid | Best of both—start with kit, customize | Still requires knowledge to modify | Recommended approach |

**Our recommendation:** Buy a quality pre-made kit as your foundation, then add personal medications, upgrade key items, and remove things you won't use.

## First Aid Training

A kit without knowledge is just a bag of supplies. Consider:

**Free resources:**
- Red Cross first aid app
- YouTube tutorials (watch before you need them)
- FEMA emergency preparedness courses

**Paid training:**
- Wilderness First Aid (WFA) — 16 hours, highly recommended
- Wilderness First Responder (WFR) — 70-80 hours, comprehensive
- Stop the Bleed — Free courses focused on hemorrhage control

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Do I need a tourniquet in my first aid kit?",
      answer: "Yes. Tourniquets save lives in severe bleeding situations. A CAT (Combat Application Tourniquet) is the gold standard. They're simple to use with basic training—watch a video and practice."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I check/rotate my first aid kit?",
      answer: "Check every 6 months. Replace expired medications, replenish used items, and inspect for moisture damage. Rotate medications annually even if not expired."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the most important first aid skill to learn?",
      answer: "Bleeding control. Most preventable deaths from trauma involve hemorrhage. Learn to apply direct pressure, pack wounds, and use a tourniquet. The 'Stop the Bleed' program offers free courses."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I include prescription medications?",
      answer: "Yes, if you or family members depend on them. Include a 7+ day supply, rotated regularly. Work with your doctor to get emergency supplies if needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Are cheap first aid kits worth buying?",
      answer: "Sometimes as a starting point, but cheap kits often have low-quality supplies—thin bandages, dull scissors, weak tape. You'll want to upgrade key items. Budget kits from Surviveware or similar are better than no-name imports."
