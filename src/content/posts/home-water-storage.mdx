# Home Water Storage: Complete Guide for Emergency Preparedness

Water is your most critical emergency supply. You can survive weeks without food but only days without water. Yet most households have less than a day's supply on hand.

This guide covers everything you need to store water at home: how much, what containers, treatment, and rotation schedules.

## How Much Water Do You Need?

**FEMA recommends:** 1 gallon per person per day for drinking and sanitation.

**Reality:** You'll want more.

| Use | Daily Need |
|-----|------------|
| Drinking | 0.5-1 gallon |
| Cooking | 0.5 gallon |
| Basic hygiene | 0.5 gallon |
| **Minimum total** | **1 gallon** |
| **Comfortable total** | **2 gallons** |

**Storage targets:**
- **3 days (minimum):** 3 gallons per person
- **2 weeks (recommended):** 14 gallons per person
- **1 month (prepared):** 30 gallons per person

<Callout type="warning">
Don't forget pets, infants (formula requires more water), and medical needs. Hot climates and physical activity increase requirements significantly—plan for 2+ gallons per person.
</Callout>

### Calculate Your Household Needs

| People | 3-Day Supply | 2-Week Supply | 1-Month Supply |
|--------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | 3 gallons | 14 gallons | 30 gallons |
| 2 | 6 gallons | 28 gallons | 60 gallons |
| 4 | 12 gallons | 56 gallons | 120 gallons |
| 6 | 18 gallons | 84 gallons | 180 gallons |

## Water Storage Containers

### Best Containers for Home Storage

**Food-grade plastic containers** are the standard choice. Look for HDPE (recycle code 2) or PET (recycle code 1).

<ProductCard slug="reliance-aqua-tainer" badge="Most Popular" />

The 7-gallon Aqua-Tainer is the workhorse of home water storage. Stackable, affordable, and includes a spigot.

**Other excellent options:**

| Container | Capacity | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Reliance Aqua-Tainer | 7 gallons | Stackable storage |
| 55-gallon drum | 55 gallons | Large-volume storage |
| WaterBrick | 3.5 gallons | Modular, portable |
| Bottled water cases | 2.5-5 gallons | Grab-and-go |

### Emergency Bathtub Storage

<ProductCard slug="aqua-pod-kit" badge="Storm Prep" />

When you have advance warning (hurricanes, winter storms), fill your bathtub with 65-100 gallons using a bathtub bladder.

**How it works:**
1. Place bladder in clean bathtub
2. Attach to faucet and fill
3. Use included pump to dispense
4. Single use—dispose after emergency

<Callout type="tip">
Keep a bathtub bladder (AquaPod or WaterBOB) ready even if you have other storage. It's cheap insurance that nearly doubles most households' water supply with 5 minutes of work.
</Callout>

### Containers to Avoid

**Don't use:**
- Milk jugs (proteins breed bacteria)
- Non-food-grade plastics
- Metal containers (rust, chemicals)
- Glass (breakage, weight)
- Previously held chemicals

## Water Treatment for Storage

Municipal tap water is already treated and safe to store directly. Well water should be treated before storage.

### Option 1: Store Tap Water As-Is

If your water comes from a chlorinated municipal supply:
1. Fill clean containers with tap water
2. Cap tightly
3. Store in cool, dark location
4. Rotate every 6-12 months

The residual chlorine keeps water safe for months.

### Option 2: Add Water Preserver

<ProductCard slug="water-preserver" badge="5-Year Storage" />

Water preserver concentrate extends storage life to 5 years by adding extra chlorine that remains stable over time.

**Usage:** Add to water at recommended dose, seal containers.

### Option 3: Treat Well Water

Well water lacks chlorine. Before storage:
- Add 1/8 teaspoon (8 drops) unscented bleach per gallon
- OR use water preserver concentrate
- Let stand 30 minutes before sealing

### Filtering vs. Storing

Storage and filtration serve different purposes:

**Stored water:** Pre-treated, ready to drink immediately.

**Water filters:** Turn questionable water safe (streams, rainwater, compromised tap).

<Callout type="info">
**Best practice:** Store enough treated water for 2+ weeks, AND keep filters to treat additional water if the emergency extends or your storage is compromised.
</Callout>

Keep backup filtration:
- <a href="/gear/best-water-filters-bug-out-bag/">Sawyer Squeeze</a> for filtering
- <a href="#">Water purification tablets</a> for viruses

## Where to Store Water

**Location requirements:**
- Cool (50-70°F ideal)
- Dark (UV degrades plastic and promotes algae)
- Away from chemicals and gasoline
- Accessible in emergency
- Won't cause flooding if containers fail

**Common storage locations:**
- Closets
- Basement (off concrete—use pallets)
- Garage (insulate in extreme climates)
- Under beds
- Utility rooms

### Weight Considerations

Water weighs 8.34 lbs per gallon. A 55-gallon drum weighs over 450 lbs when full.

| Storage | Full Weight |
|---------|-------------|
| 7-gallon container | 58 lbs |
| 5-gallon jug | 42 lbs |
| 55-gallon drum | 459 lbs |

**Important:** Place large containers in their final location BEFORE filling. Upper floors may have weight limits—consult if storing significant amounts.

## Rotation Schedule

Even properly stored water should be rotated:

| Storage Method | Rotation Frequency |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Tap water (no treatment) | Every 6 months |
| Tap water + bleach | Every 12 months |
| Water preserver treated | Every 5 years |
| Commercial bottled water | Check expiration |
| 55-gallon drums | Every 1-5 years |

<Callout type="tip">
**Easy rotation method:** Label containers with storage date. Use oldest water first for cooking, coffee, pets, plants. Refill empty containers immediately.
</Callout>

## Emergency Water Sources

If your stored water runs out, know your backup options:

### Safe (with filtration/treatment)
- Rainwater
- Streams, rivers, lakes
- Swimming pools (filter + treat)
- Water heater tank (40-80 gallons!)
- Toilet tanks (not bowls—skip if chemicals added)
- Waterbeds (treat heavily or use for sanitation only)

### Unsafe—Avoid
- Floodwater
- Water near industrial areas
- Toilet bowls
- Radiator fluid
- Water with floating material or odor

### Water Heater as Emergency Source

Your water heater holds 30-80 gallons of fresh water:

1. Turn off electricity/gas to heater
2. Turn off water supply to house
3. Open a hot water faucet to release pressure
4. Attach hose to drain valve OR open drain valve into container
5. Open pressure relief valve to allow drainage

<Callout type="warning">
Let water heater water cool before collecting—it can be scalding hot. The first few gallons may contain sediment; let it settle.
</Callout>

## Building Your Water Storage System

### Starter Setup (~$50)

- 4× Reliance Aqua-Tainer 7-gallon ($15-20 each) = 28 gallons
- 1× AquaPod bathtub bladder ($25) = 65 gallon emergency backup

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Does stored water go bad?",
      answer: "Water itself doesn't expire, but storage containers can leach chemicals, and improperly stored water can grow bacteria or algae. Properly stored treated water in food-grade containers remains safe for 6-12 months (or 5+ years with water preserver)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I store water in my garage?",
      answer: "Yes, but protect from temperature extremes and sunlight. Insulate containers in very hot or cold climates. Keep away from gasoline, pesticides, and other chemicals—vapors can permeate some plastics."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I sanitize used water containers?",
      answer: "Wash with dish soap, rinse thoroughly, then sanitize with 1 teaspoon unscented bleach per quart of water. Swish solution around all surfaces, let stand 30 seconds, then rinse with clean water and air dry."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe to store water in plastic long-term?",
      answer: "Food-grade plastics (HDPE, PET) are safe for water storage. Avoid storing in direct sunlight, which degrades plastic. BPA-free containers are widely available. Commercial water bottles use the same plastics."
    },
    {
      question: "How much bleach to add to stored water?",
      answer: "Add 1/8 teaspoon (8 drops) of regular unscented bleach per gallon. Use only plain bleach (8.25% sodium hypochlorite)—no scents, cleaners, or additives. Water should have slight chlorine smell after treatment."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I drink pool water in an emergency?",
      answer: "Pool water is relatively safe in true emergencies, but filter and treat it first. The chlorine makes it safer than pond water. Don't drink saltwater pool water or water that's been treated with algaecides or other chemicals."
    }
