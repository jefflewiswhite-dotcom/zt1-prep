# How to Build a Get Home Bag: Complete Beginner Guide

A get home bag (GHB) is a compact kit that helps you travel from wherever you are—work, school, the store—back to your home during an emergency. It's lighter and more portable than a [bug out bag](/guides/bug-out-bag), focused on one goal: getting you home safely.

Think of it as insurance for your commute. When public transit stops, roads gridlock, or you need to travel on foot, your GHB has what you need.

## What Is a Get Home Bag?

A get home bag is a portable kit designed to help you travel from your location back home during disruptions. Unlike a bug out bag (which prepares you to leave home), a GHB assumes home is your destination.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Compact** — Small enough for your car trunk, desk drawer, or locker
- **Lightweight** — 5-15 lbs, comfortable for extended walking
- **Focused** — Essentials for 12-24 hours of travel
- **Everyday ready** — Stored where you spend time away from home

## Who Needs a Get Home Bag?

Consider building a GHB if you:

- Commute more than 10 miles from home
- Work in an urban area with traffic/transit dependency
- Spend extended time away from home regularly
- Have family members who depend on you getting home
- Live in an area with earthquake, weather, or infrastructure risks

<Callout type="info" title="Distance Matters">
If you work 5 miles from home, you could walk it in 2 hours. If you work 30 miles away, you need more supplies for what could be a full day or longer journey.

**Bottom line:** A GHB is smaller and lighter because you're traveling to safety (home), not away from it. You don't need full survival gear—you need enough to complete your journey.

## The Core Categories of a Get Home Bag

### 1. Water & Hydration

Dehydration slows you down and clouds your thinking. Even a 12-hour walk requires significant water.

**Pack:**
- 1 liter of water (minimum)
- Compact water filter or purification tablets
- Collapsible water bottle for resupply

<ProductCard slug="lifestraw-personal" />

**Tip:** Urban environments usually have water sources (fountains, restaurants, gas stations). A filter lets you use them safely.

### 2. Shelter & Warmth (Compact)

You may need to rest, wait out bad weather, or spend an unexpected night out.

**Pack:**
- Emergency bivvy (weighs 3-4 oz)
- Compact rain poncho
- Extra layer (packable jacket or fleece)
- Emergency blanket (backup)

<ProductCard slug="sol-emergency-bivvy" variant="compact" />

**Urban consideration:** Bridges, parking garages, and building overhangs provide partial shelter. Your bivvy handles the rest.

### 3. Light

Days can turn to night mid-journey. Proper lighting keeps you moving safely.

**Pack:**
- Small flashlight OR headlamp
- Extra batteries
- Keychain light as backup

<ProductCard slug="petzl-actik-core" variant="compact" />

**Headlamps win** for GHBs—hands-free operation matters when you're walking and navigating.

### 4. First Aid (Compact)

Focus on the injuries most likely during extended walking: blisters, minor cuts, and soreness.

**Pack:**
- Compact first aid kit
- Extra blister care (moleskin is essential)
- Pain relievers
- Personal medications (3+ day supply)

<ProductCard slug="adventure-medical-kits-ultralight" />

<Callout type="warning">
Blisters can stop your journey. Quality footwear and blister prevention/treatment are critical for any GHB.
</Callout>

### 5. Tools

Keep it simple—a small multitool handles most GHB needs.

**Pack:**
- Compact multitool OR Swiss Army knife
- Small amount of duct tape (wrapped around a card)
- Zip ties
- Small flashlight (if not in lighting category)

<ProductCard slug="victorinox-swiss-army-huntsman" />

**Note:** Check local laws. Some cities restrict knife blade lengths.

### 6. Food & Energy

You're not living off this food—just maintaining energy for your journey.

**Pack:**
- 1,200-2,000 calories of compact food
- Energy bars, nuts, dried fruit
- Hard candy (morale and quick energy)
- Electrolyte packets

**Keep it simple:** Calorie-dense, no-cook foods that won't melt, freeze, or spoil in your car/office.

### 7. Communication & Power

Your phone is your navigation, communication, and information tool. Keep it powered.

**Pack:**
- Power bank (10,000mAh minimum)
- Charging cable
- Small emergency radio (optional)
- Whistle for signaling
- Written contacts and addresses

<ProductCard slug="anker-powercore-10000" />

### 8. Navigation

Your phone helps, but don't depend on it exclusively.

**Pack:**
- Local/regional maps (paper)
- Know your route home (multiple options)
- Compass (if traveling through unfamiliar areas)

**Pre-plan:** Walk or drive your route home. Identify landmarks, safe stopping points, and alternate routes.

### 9. Cash & Documents

Infrastructure failures often mean no card payments.

**Pack:**
- $50-100 in small bills
- Coins for vending machines
- Copy of ID
- Emergency contacts (written)

### 10. Comfort & Clothing

Comfort keeps you moving. Discomfort slows you down.

**Pack:**
- Comfortable walking shoes (if not wearing them)
- Extra socks (game-changer)
- Bandana or buff (multiple uses)
- Sunglasses
- Small hygiene items (wet wipes, toilet paper)

<Callout type="tip" title="Footwear Is Critical">
If you wear dress shoes or heels to work, keep a pair of broken-in walking shoes in your GHB. Nothing stops a journey faster than foot pain.

## Weight Target

Your GHB should stay between 5-15 lbs—light enough to carry comfortably for hours of walking.

| Commute Distance | Suggested Weight | Notes |
|------------------|------------------|-------|
| Under 10 miles | 5-8 lbs | Minimal kit, focus on speed |
| 10-25 miles | 8-12 lbs | Full GHB essentials |
| 25+ miles | 12-15 lbs | Extended supplies, possible overnight |

**Test it:** Put on your loaded GHB and walk 2-3 miles. If it's uncomfortable, lighten the load.

## Storage Locations

Your GHB only works if it's with you when you need it.

**Best locations:**
- **Car trunk** — Most common, always with you during commute
- **Office desk/locker** — If you don't drive or park far away
- **Divided between car and office** — Core items in both locations

**Rotation tip:** Check your GHB monthly if stored in a hot or cold vehicle. Extreme temperatures degrade some items.

## Urban vs. Suburban vs. Rural Considerations

### Urban GHB Additions
- Transit maps and schedules
- Building entry tools (work ID, keys)
- Extra cash for taxis or services
- Gray/neutral bag (don't draw attention)

### Suburban GHB Additions
- More water (longer distances between sources)
- Better footwear for varied terrain
- Reflective gear for road walking

### Rural GHB Additions
- Larger water capacity
- More substantial shelter
- Navigation tools (compass, detailed maps)
- Approaches a small BOB in scope

## Scenarios: How Your GHB Helps

**Scenario 1: Major earthquake**
Transit is down, roads are damaged. You grab your GHB and walk home using pre-planned routes, stopping to rest and hydrate. Your bivvy keeps you warm if you need to shelter overnight.

**Scenario 2: Severe winter storm**
Your car slides off the road or traffic is completely stopped. Your GHB provides warmth, light, food, and communication while you wait for help or decide to walk.

**Scenario 3: Civil unrest or infrastructure failure**
Normal transportation isn't safe or available. Your GHB lets you avoid crowds, take indirect routes, and travel self-sufficiently.

**Scenario 4: Extended power outage**
Your workplace loses power and sends everyone home. Transit isn't running, traffic lights are out. Your GHB helps you navigate the chaos.

## Mistakes to Avoid

**Packing too much.** This isn't a BOB. You're getting home, not surviving in the wilderness. Keep it light.

**Forgetting comfortable footwear.** If you can't walk comfortably, you can't get home.

**Ignoring maintenance.** Check your GHB seasonally. Rotate food. Charge your power bank.

**No route planning.** Know multiple ways home. Highways might be blocked; have alternatives.

**Over-tactical appearance.** A gray or black backpack blends in. Military-style bags attract attention.

## Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Check power bank charge | Monthly |
| Rotate water in hot climates | Monthly |
| Check food/medication dates | Every 3 months |
| Adjust for seasonal clothing | Spring and fall |
| Full review and test | Yearly |

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How is a GHB different from an EDC (Everyday Carry)?",
      answer: "EDC items are on your person daily (wallet, phone, pocket knife). A GHB is a separate bag with supplies for getting home during emergencies. They complement each other—your EDC handles daily life, your GHB handles getting home during disruptions."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I keep a GHB in my car and my office?",
      answer: "If feasible, yes—or at least split key items between locations. The best GHB is the one you have access to when you need it."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I take public transit?",
      answer: "Keep a compact GHB at your workplace since your car isn't available. Focus on lightweight items—you may be carrying this bag daily or storing it in a small space."
    },
    {
      question: "How much should a GHB cost?",
      answer: "A solid GHB costs $75-150. You likely already have some items (flashlight, power bank, first aid supplies). Fill gaps over time."
    },
    {
      question: "Can my GHB double as my EDC bag?",
      answer: "Yes, if you're willing to carry it daily. Some people use a messenger bag or backpack that contains GHB essentials plus daily items. Just ensure GHB items stay in the bag."
