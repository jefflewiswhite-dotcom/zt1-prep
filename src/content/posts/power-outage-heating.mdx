# Power Outage Heating: How to Stay Warm Without Electricity

The power goes out. The temperature outside is 15°F and dropping. Your furnace is useless without electricity, and the forecast says it could be days before power is restored.

This scenario plays out thousands of times every winter. Knowing how to safely heat your home without electricity can mean the difference between discomfort and danger.

## How Fast Does a House Get Cold?

Without heat, a house loses temperature faster than most people expect:

| Outside Temp | Time to Reach 50°F Inside | Time to Reach Freezing |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 30°F | 8-12 hours | 24-36 hours |
| 20°F | 4-8 hours | 12-24 hours |
| 10°F | 2-4 hours | 8-12 hours |
| 0°F | 1-3 hours | 4-8 hours |

*Times vary based on insulation, home size, and starting temperature*

**Bottom line:** You have hours, not days, to establish alternative heating in cold weather.

## Safe Emergency Heating Options

<Callout type="warning" title="Carbon Monoxide Kills">
Every winter storm brings CO poisoning deaths from improper heater use. Never use outdoor-only heaters, grills, or generators inside. Have battery-powered CO detectors on every level.
</Callout>

### Option 1: Indoor-Safe Propane Heaters

The most popular and practical emergency heating option for most homes.

**Best for:** Small to medium rooms, apartments, homes without fireplaces

<ProductCard slug="mr-heater-buddy" badge="Best Seller" />

<ProductCard slug="mr-heater-big-buddy" badge="More BTUs" />

**Why propane heaters work well:**
- No electricity required
- Heats quickly (9,000-18,000 BTU)
- Propane stores indefinitely
- Indoor-rated models have oxygen depletion sensors (ODS)
- Relatively affordable ($75-150)

**Safety requirements:**
- Use ONLY indoor-rated models with ODS
- Have CO detectors (battery-powered)
- Provide ventilation (crack window 1 inch)
- Keep away from combustibles
- Turn off when sleeping

**Fuel planning:**
| Heater | 1-lb Cylinder Runtime | 20-lb Tank Runtime |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Buddy (Low) | 5.4 hours | 108 hours |
| Buddy (High) | 2.4 hours | 48 hours |
| Big Buddy (Low) | 5.4 hours | 108 hours |
| Big Buddy (High) | 1.1 hours | 22 hours |

**Recommendation:** Stock 10-20 1-lb cylinders, plus a 20-lb tank with adapter hose.

### Option 2: Kerosene Heaters

Higher heat output than propane, better for larger spaces.

**Best for:** Larger rooms, garages, very cold climates

**Pros:**
- High heat output (10,000-23,000 BTU)
- Kerosene is energy-dense
- Can heat larger areas
- Works in extremely cold temperatures

**Cons:**
- More fumes than propane
- Kerosene can be hard to find
- Requires more ventilation
- Fuel doesn't store as long

**Safety:**
- Use only K-1 kerosene (not diesel)
- Requires more ventilation than propane
- Never refuel while hot
- Keep fire extinguisher nearby

### Option 3: Wood Stove or Fireplace

If you have one, this is the ultimate backup heat source.

**Pros:**
- Unlimited heat potential
- Can also cook
- No fuel supply chain (if you have wood)
- Creates comfortable radiant heat

**Cons:**
- Requires existing installation
- Need dry, seasoned firewood
- Must be properly maintained
- Fire risk

**If you use your fireplace:**
- Use seasoned hardwood (oak, maple, hickory)
- Open damper fully
- Use a fireplace screen
- Clean ashes regularly
- Never leave unattended

### Option 4: Generator + Space Heater

Use a generator to power electric space heaters.

**Pros:**
- Uses safe electric heat
- Can power other essentials
- Most familiar heat source

**Cons:**
- Generator MUST be outdoors
- Requires gasoline storage
- Expensive fuel consumption
- Extension cord limitations

**Sizing:** A 1500W space heater needs a 2000W+ generator. Add your other loads.

### Option 5: Passive Heating Strategies

No fuel required—maximize what you have:

**Body heat concentration:**
- Everyone in one room
- Small, interior room (less exterior walls)
- Keep doors closed

**Insulation improvements:**
- Hang blankets over windows
- Roll towels under doors
- Cover bare floors with rugs/blankets
- Close blinds and curtains

**Thermal mass:**
- Heat water bottles or rocks (if you can)
- Place warm objects in sleeping bags before bed

## Room Isolation Strategy

You can't heat your whole house without a furnace. Focus on one room.

### Choosing Your Warm Room

**Best options:**
- Small bedroom (less volume to heat)
- Interior room (fewer exterior walls)
- Room with minimal windows
- Away from north-facing walls

**Avoid:**
- Large open spaces
- Rooms with lots of windows
- Rooms over unheated garage
- Corners of the house

### Setting Up Your Warm Room

1. **Choose the smallest practical room** for your family
2. **Seal it off** — Close all doors to the rest of the house
3. **Insulate windows** — Hang blankets, sleeping bags, or plastic
4. **Block door gaps** — Roll towels at the bottom
5. **Cover floor** — Rugs and blankets trap air
6. **Set up sleeping area** — Mattresses on floor, sleeping bags
7. **Place heater** — Follow all safety guidelines
8. **Install CO detector** — Essential with any fuel-burning heat

### Temperature Goals

You don't need 68°F to survive:

| Temperature | Comfort Level | Safety |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| 60-65°F | Comfortable with layers | Safe |
| 55-60°F | Cool, need sweaters | Safe |
| 50-55°F | Cold, need blankets | Safe for healthy adults |
| 45-50°F | Very cold, limit exposure | Risk for elderly/infants |
| Below 45°F | Dangerous without protection | Hypothermia risk |

**Target:** Keep your warm room above 50°F minimum. 55-60°F is manageable with layers.

## Sleeping Warm Without Heat

Sleep is when you're most vulnerable to cold. Prepare properly:

### Sleeping Gear

**Use sleeping bags, not blankets:**
- Sleeping bags trap heat far better
- 20°F or 0°F rated bags are ideal
- Mummy style is warmest (less air space)
- Place on insulated surface (mattress, foam pad)

### Sleeping Tips

- Wear a hat (you lose significant heat through your head)
- Wear dry base layers (not cotton)
- Use hand/toe warmers inside the sleeping bag
- Don't bury your face (creates moisture)
- Hot water bottle at your feet (if you can heat water)
- Share body heat (zip sleeping bags together)

### Protecting Vulnerable Family Members

**Infants and elderly are at highest risk:**
- Keep them closest to heat source
- Check on them frequently
- Watch for signs of hypothermia
- Keep them well-fed and hydrated
- Don't let them sleep alone

## Signs of Hypothermia

Know the warning signs:

**Early (Mild):**
- Shivering
- Cold hands and feet
- Numbness

**Moderate:**
- Intense shivering
- Slurred speech
- Drowsiness
- Confusion

**Severe:**
- Shivering stops
- Extreme drowsiness
- Weak pulse
- Unconsciousness

**If you see these signs:**
1. Move to warmest area
2. Remove wet clothing
3. Warm the core first (not extremities)
4. Skin-to-skin contact under blankets
5. Warm, sweet drinks if conscious
6. Seek medical help for moderate/severe cases

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can I use my gas oven for heat?",
      answer: "No. Gas ovens are not designed for space heating and produce carbon monoxide. The open flame is also a fire hazard. This is a dangerous practice that causes deaths every winter."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe to sleep with a propane heater on?",
      answer: "Generally not recommended. Turn off fuel-burning heaters when sleeping. Heat the room thoroughly before bed, use quality sleeping bags, and re-heat in the morning. If you must run a heater at night, use the lowest setting and ensure CO detectors are working."
    },
    {
      question: "How much propane do I need for a 3-day outage?",
      answer: "For a Mr. Heater Buddy running 8 hours/day on low, you'd use about 1.5 1-lb cylinders per day, so 5 cylinders for 3 days. Always stock more than you think you need—10-20 cylinders is a reasonable supply."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't have any heating equipment?",
      answer: "Use passive strategies: gather everyone in one small room, hang blankets on windows, block door drafts, use sleeping bags, layer clothing, and huddle together for body heat. This can keep you safe through a 24-48 hour outage in moderate cold."
    },
    {
      question: "At what point should I leave my house?",
      answer: "If you cannot maintain at least 45-50°F for vulnerable family members (infants, elderly, ill), if pipes have frozen, or if you're running out of fuel with no resupply possible, it's time to go to a warming shelter, hotel, or friend's house with power."
