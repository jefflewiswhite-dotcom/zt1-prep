# Best Portable Generators for Home Backup Power

When the power goes out, a portable generator keeps your furnace running, your fridge cold, and your phones charged. For winter storm preparedness, it's one of the most valuable pieces of equipment you can own.

This guide covers what size generator you need, the best models for home backup, and critical safety information.

## Quick Picks

| Need | Recommendation | Price Range |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Best Overall** | Honda EU2200i | $1,000-1,200 |
| **Best Value** | Champion 3400W | $500-600 |
| **Best Large Capacity** | Westinghouse iGen4500 | $800-1,000 |
| **Budget Pick** | Predator 3500 | $700-800 |

## How to Size a Generator

**Step 1: List your essential loads**

| Appliance | Running Watts | Starting Watts |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Furnace blower | 300-500W | 500-1000W |
| Refrigerator | 100-200W | 400-600W |
| Sump pump | 400-600W | 800-1200W |
| Lights (LED) | 10-50W | Same |
| Phone charger | 5-20W | Same |
| TV | 100-300W | Same |
| Space heater (1500W) | 1500W | Same |

**Step 2: Add your running watts**
Example: Furnace (400) + Fridge (150) + Lights (30) + Phone (10) = **590 running watts**

**Step 3: Add highest starting watts**
Furnace starting surge: 800W
Total needed: 590 running + 800 starting = **~1400 watts minimum**

**Recommendation:** For most homes, a **2000-3500W inverter generator** handles furnace + fridge + lights comfortably.

<Callout type="tip">
Get 20-30% more capacity than your calculated need. You'll find more things to plug in during an outage.

## Inverter vs Conventional Generators

| Factor | Inverter | Conventional |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Noise** | 50-60 dB (quiet) | 70-80 dB (loud) |
| **Fuel efficiency** | Excellent (variable speed) | Fair (constant speed) |
| **Power quality** | Clean sine wave | Rougher, can damage electronics |
| **Price** | Higher ($500-1500) | Lower ($300-800) |
| **Weight** | Lighter | Heavier |
| **Best for** | Home backup, electronics | Job sites, high loads |

**For home backup:** Inverter generators are worth the premium. They're quieter (neighbors will thank you), more fuel-efficient, and safer for sensitive electronics.

## Generator Safety

<Callout type="warning" title="Generators Kill People Every Year">
Carbon monoxide from generators causes deaths during every major power outage. These rules are non-negotiable.
</Callout>

**Location:**
- Run ONLY outdoors
- At least 20 feet from any window, door, or vent
- Point exhaust away from house
- Never in garage, even with door open

**Operation:**
- Let cool before refueling
- Use fresh fuel (add stabilizer if stored)
- Don't overload (causes damage and fire risk)
- Use heavy-duty outdoor-rated extension cords

**Never do this:**
- Run indoors or in enclosed space
- Backfeed into house wiring (hire electrician for transfer switch)
- Refuel while running
- Touch with wet hands

## Fuel Storage Tips

- Store gasoline in approved containers
- Use fuel stabilizer (gas goes bad in 3-6 months)
- Store away from living areas and ignition sources
- 10-15 gallons is a reasonable emergency supply
- Rotate fuel every 6-12 months

## Generator Maintenance

**Before storm season:**
- Run generator for 15-30 minutes monthly
- Check oil level before each use
- Change oil per manufacturer schedule
- Inspect air filter
- Test all outlets with a load

**After each use:**
- Run until fuel is used OR add stabilizer
- Turn off fuel valve if equipped
- Store in dry location

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can a 2000W generator run a furnace?",
      answer: "Usually yes. Most furnace blowers use 300-500W running, with 500-1000W starting surge. A 2000W inverter generator handles this plus lights, phone chargers, and small electronics. Check your furnace's electrical requirements to be sure."
    },
    {
      question: "How long will a generator run on a tank of gas?",
      answer: "At 25-50% load, most generators run 8-12 hours per tank. A 2-gallon tank at 25% load might run 8+ hours. Plan for 1-2 gallons per day for basic home backup."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I get an inverter or conventional generator?",
      answer: "For home backup, get an inverter generator. They're quieter, more fuel-efficient, and produce cleaner power that's safe for electronics. Conventional generators are better for job sites and high-power tools."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a transfer switch?",
      answer: "You don't need one for basic use with extension cords. However, a transfer switch ($200-500 installed) lets you safely power your home's circuits directly, which is more convenient and can power hardwired appliances like your furnace."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I parallel two small generators?",
      answer: "Yes, if they're designed for it (most Honda and similar inverter generators have parallel capability). Two 2200W generators can combine for 4400W. You'll need a parallel kit ($50-150)."
