# How to Build a Bug Out Bag: Complete Beginner Guide

A bug out bag (BOB) is a pre-packed kit that lets you survive independently for 72 hours if you need to evacuate your home quickly. Whether it's a wildfire, hurricane, flood, or other emergency, your BOB gives you everything essential in one grab-and-go package.

This guide walks you through building your first bug out bag—what to include, how to prioritize, and how to avoid common mistakes.

## What Is a Bug Out Bag?

A bug out bag is a portable kit containing the supplies you need to survive for at least 72 hours (3 days) away from home. The name comes from military slang—"bugging out" means evacuating quickly.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Self-contained** — Everything you need in one bag
- **Portable** — Light enough to carry for extended periods
- **Ready to go** — Packed and stored where you can grab it fast
- **72-hour minimum** — Enough supplies for 3 days of independence

<Callout type="info" title="Bug Out Bag vs. Other Kits">
A BOB is different from a [get home bag](/guides/get-home-bag) (smaller, for getting home from work) or a [72-hour kit](/guides/72-hour-kit) (home-based supplies). Your BOB is specifically for leaving home quickly.
</Callout>

## Who Needs a Bug Out Bag?

Not everyone needs a full bug out bag. Consider building one if you:

- Live in an area prone to wildfires, hurricanes, or floods
- Could face evacuation orders
- Live in a location with limited exit routes
- Want maximum preparedness for any scenario

If evacuation is unlikely in your area, focus on a [home 72-hour kit](/guides/72-hour-kit) first.

## The 10 Categories of Bug Out Bag Essentials

Every bug out bag should address these ten survival priorities:

### 1. Water (Top Priority)

Water is your most critical need. You can survive weeks without food but only days without water.

**Pack:**
- 1-2 liters of water in durable bottles
- Water filter (like the Sawyer Squeeze)
- Purification tablets as backup
- Collapsible water container for resupply

<ProductCard slug="sawyer-squeeze" badge="Top Pick" />

**How much?** Minimum 1 liter carried, plus filtration/purification for more.

[See our complete guide: Best Water Filters for Bug Out Bags →](/gear/best-water-filters-bug-out-bag)

### 2. Shelter & Sleep

Protection from the elements can be life-saving. Even in mild weather, nights get cold.

**Pack:**
- Emergency bivvy or lightweight sleeping bag
- Compact tarp (8x10 ft minimum)
- Paracord (50-100 ft)
- Ground pad or emergency blanket

<ProductCard slug="sol-emergency-bivvy" />

**Decision:** [Emergency Bivvy vs. Sleeping Bag—which should you pack?](/comparisons/emergency-bivvy-vs-sleeping-bag)

### 3. Fire & Heat

Fire provides warmth, water purification, cooking, signaling, and morale.

**Pack:**
- Primary: Bic lighter in waterproof case
- Backup: Ferro rod fire starter
- Tinder: Cotton balls with petroleum jelly or commercial fire starters
- Optional: Compact stove for cooking

**Tip:** Pack 3 ways to make fire. Lighters fail, matches get wet, ferro rods need practice—redundancy matters.

<ProductCard slug="exotac-firesleeve" />

[Best Fire Starters for Bug Out Bags →](/gear/best-fire-starters-bug-out-bag)

### 4. Light

Darkness makes everything harder. Good lighting is essential for safety and morale.

**Pack:**
- Primary flashlight (200+ lumens)
- Headlamp for hands-free work
- Extra batteries
- Optional: Glow sticks for marking/signaling

<ProductCard slug="streamlight-protac" />

[Compare: Flashlight vs. Headlamp—Which Should You Pack?](/comparisons/flashlight-vs-headlamp)

### 5. First Aid

Most emergencies involve minor injuries. Be ready to handle cuts, burns, blisters, and sprains.

**Pack:**
- Quality first aid kit (not dollar store junk)
- Personal medications (2-week supply minimum)
- Blister care (moleskin, bandages)
- Pain relievers, antihistamines, anti-diarrhea meds

<ProductCard slug="surviveware-large-first-aid" />

<Callout type="warning">
This is not medical advice. Learn basic first aid skills—the Red Cross offers excellent courses. Your kit is only as good as your knowledge.
</Callout>

[First Aid Kit Basics →](/guides/first-aid-kit-basics)

### 6. Tools

A good cutting tool handles countless tasks—shelter building, food prep, repairs, and more.

**Pack:**
- Fixed blade knife OR quality multitool
- Duct tape (wrap around water bottle to save space)
- Zip ties
- Small repair kit (needle, thread, safety pins)

<ProductCard slug="leatherman-wave-plus" />

[Multitool vs. Fixed Blade—What to Pack?](/comparisons/multitool-vs-fixed-blade-knife)

### 7. Food

You can survive without food for 72 hours, but calories maintain energy and morale.

**Pack:**
- Emergency food bars (2,400-3,600 calories)
- Optional: Freeze-dried meals (require water and stove)
- Energy bars or trail mix
- Electrolyte packets

<ProductCard slug="datrex-emergency-food-bars" />

**Tip:** Focus on calorie density and shelf life over taste. This is survival food, not camping food.

### 8. Navigation

If you need to evacuate on foot, knowing where you're going matters.

**Pack:**
- Local/regional maps (paper, not phone-dependent)
- Compass (learn basic use)
- GPS device or phone with offline maps

**Know:** Your evacuation routes—primary and alternates.

### 9. Communication & Power

Information and the ability to reach others can be critical.

**Pack:**
- Emergency radio (NOAA weather band)
- Power bank (10,000+ mAh)
- Charging cables
- Written list of emergency contacts

<ProductCard slug="midland-er310" />

<ProductCard slug="anker-powercore-10000" />

[Best Emergency Radios →](/gear/best-emergency-radios-bug-out-bag) | [Best Power Banks →](/gear/best-power-banks-bug-out-bag)

### 10. Documents & Personal

Important documents and personal items round out your kit.

**Pack:**
- Copies of IDs, insurance, medical info (waterproofed)
- Cash (small bills)
- Emergency contact list
- Change of clothes (weather-appropriate)
- Hygiene basics (toilet paper, hand sanitizer, toothbrush)

### Comfort & Morale Items

Don't underestimate morale. [Survival experts](https://bugoutbagacademy.com/free-bug-out-bag-list/) consistently recommend packing a few comfort items—being mentally resilient matters as much as physical supplies.

  items={[

If you have children, [Mountain House](https://mountainhouse.com/blogs/emergency-prep-survival/kids-bug-out-bag) and [TruePrepper](https://trueprepper.com/kids-bug-out-bag/) recommend packing kid-specific items. Children need comfort even more than adults during emergencies.

    { item: "Coloring book and crayons", priority: "recommended", note: "Keeps kids occupied during waiting" },

  ]}

<Callout type="tip">
Involve your kids in building their own bag (age-appropriate). It helps them understand preparedness and reduces fear during actual emergencies.
</Callout>

## Weight Guidelines

Your bug out bag should be light enough to carry for extended periods—especially if you're traveling on foot.

**General guidelines:**
- **Beginner/unfit:** 10-15% of body weight
- **Average fitness:** 15-20% of body weight
- **Very fit/experienced:** 20-25% of body weight

| Body Weight | Light Load | Medium Load | Heavy Load |
|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| 120 lbs | 12-18 lbs | 18-24 lbs | 24-30 lbs |
| 150 lbs | 15-23 lbs | 23-30 lbs | 30-38 lbs |
| 180 lbs | 18-27 lbs | 27-36 lbs | 36-45 lbs |
| 200 lbs | 20-30 lbs | 30-40 lbs | 40-50 lbs |

<Callout type="tip">
Pack your bag and walk a mile. If it's uncomfortable, it's too heavy. An overloaded bag you can't carry is useless.
</Callout>

## Packing Order

Pack your bag strategically for access and weight distribution:

**Bottom:** Sleeping system, extra clothes (rarely needed during the day)

**Middle:** Food, water containers, heavier items (close to your back)

**Top:** Rain gear, first aid, snacks (frequent access)

**Outer pockets:** Flashlight, map, multitool, water bottle (immediate access)

**On your person:** Knife, lighter, small flashlight, whistle (always accessible)

## Choosing the Right Backpack

Your bag itself matters. Look for:

- **Capacity:** 35-50 liters for most BOBs
- **Comfort:** Padded hip belt and shoulder straps
- **Durability:** Quality zippers, reinforced stress points
- **MOLLE/attachment points:** For adding pouches
- **Neutral colors:** Gray, tan, green—avoid tactical black if you want to blend in

**Don't:** Use a school backpack. It lacks support for the weight you'll carry.

## Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

**Too much stuff.** The #1 mistake. Every item should have a purpose. If you're not sure you need it, leave it out.

**No practice.** Pack your bag, wear it, test your gear. Know how everything works before you need it.

**Set it and forget it.** Check your bag every 6 months. Rotate food and water, replace expired items, update documents.

**Copying someone else's list exactly.** Your bag should reflect your climate, fitness level, and likely scenarios. A desert bag differs from a northern winter bag.

**All gear, no skills.** A $500 bag won't help if you can't start a fire, navigate, or dress a wound. Practice matters more than gear.

## Maintaining Your Bug Out Bag

| Task | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| Check batteries | Monthly |
| Rotate food/water | Every 6 months |
| Check medications | Every 6 months |
| Update documents | Yearly |
| Full inspection and test | Yearly |
| Adjust for season | Spring and fall |

## Bug Out Bag vs. Get Home Bag

| Feature | Bug Out Bag | Get Home Bag |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Purpose | Evacuate home, survive 72+ hours | Get home from work/away |
| Weight | 15-30+ lbs | 5-15 lbs |
| Duration | 72 hours minimum | 24 hours typical |
| Location | At home, ready to grab | In car or office |
| Contents | Full survival kit | Compact essentials |

## Next Steps

1. **Start with the essentials.** Water, shelter, first aid, light, and a way to communicate.
2. **Fill gaps over time.** You don't need to buy everything at once.
3. **Test your bag.** Pack it, wear it, use your gear.
4. **Make a plan.** Know your evacuation routes and destinations.
5. **Review regularly.** Update and maintain your kit.

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How much does a complete bug out bag cost?",
      answer: "A solid starter BOB costs $150-300. You can go cheaper with budget gear ($100-150) or higher with premium equipment ($500+). Start with basics and upgrade over time."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I build or buy a pre-made bug out bag?",
      answer: "Build your own. Pre-made bags often contain low-quality gear and miss important items. Building lets you customize for your needs and learn your equipment."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I update my bug out bag?",
      answer: "Do a quick check monthly (batteries, medications), rotate food and water every 6 months, and do a full review yearly. Also update for seasonal changes."
    },
    {
      question: "Where should I store my bug out bag?",
      answer: "Somewhere accessible that you pass regularly—near your front door, in a hall closet, or by the door to your garage. If you can't grab it in 60 seconds during an evacuation, it's in the wrong place."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a bug out bag and an INCH bag?",
      answer: "A BOB is for 72-hour emergencies. An INCH bag (I'm Never Coming Home) is a larger kit for indefinite survival scenarios. Most people only need a BOB—INCH bags are for extreme situations."
    }
