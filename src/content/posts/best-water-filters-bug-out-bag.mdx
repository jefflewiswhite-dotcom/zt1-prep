Water is your most critical survival need. A reliable water filter turns questionable water sources into safe drinking water, reducing what you need to carry and extending how long you can survive independently.

## Detailed Reviews

### 1. Sawyer Squeeze — Best Overall

<ProductCard slug="sawyer-squeeze" badge="Top Pick" variant="featured" />

The Sawyer Squeeze is the gold standard for BOB water filtration. Its 0.1 micron absolute filtration removes 99.99999% of bacteria and 99.9999% of protozoa—exceeding EPA standards.

**Why it wins:**
- Versatile: Use as straw, gravity system, or inline filter
- 100,000 gallon lifespan (practically unlimited)
- Field cleanable with included syringe
- Lightweight at just 3 oz

**Considerations:**
- Squeeze bags can wear out (bring spares or use bottles)
- Can freeze and crack in winter
- Slower than some alternatives

**Best for:** Overall BOB use, anyone wanting maximum versatility

---

### 2. LifeStraw Personal — Best for Simplicity

<ProductCard slug="lifestraw-personal" badge="Most Popular" />

The LifeStraw is iconic for a reason—it's dead simple. No squeezing, no bags, no setup. Put one end in water, drink from the other.

**Why we like it:**
- Absolutely foolproof operation
- No batteries, moving parts, or maintenance
- Ultralight at 2 oz
- Affordable entry point to water filtration

**Considerations:**
- Can't store filtered water (must drink directly from source)
- 1,000 gallon lifespan (less than Sawyer)
- Not ideal for filling containers

**Best for:** [Get home bags](/guides/get-home-bag), backup filter, simplicity-focused users

---

### 3. Katadyn BeFree — Best Flow Rate

The BeFree offers the fastest flow rate of any personal filter—drink almost as fast as an unfiltered bottle.

**Why we like it:**
- Exceptionally fast flow
- Shake-to-clean design (no backflushing needed)
- Soft flask is comfortable to squeeze
- Only 2.3 oz with flask

**Considerations:**
- Soft flask is less durable than hard bottles
- Can clog faster in silty water
- Filter life is lower (1,000 liters)

**Best for:** Active users who prioritize speed, ultralight setups

---

### 4. Sawyer Mini — Best Budget Option

The Sawyer Mini offers 90% of the Squeeze's performance at a lower price and smaller size.

**Why we like it:**
- Same 0.1 micron filtration as Squeeze
- Even smaller and lighter
- 100,000 gallon lifespan
- Very affordable

**Considerations:**
- Slower flow rate than Squeeze
- Harder to backflush due to size
- Best as backup rather than primary

**Best for:** Budget builds, secondary/backup filter, [car emergency kits](/guides/car-emergency-kit)

---

### 5. MSR TrailShot — Best Pump-Style

For those who prefer pumping to squeezing, the TrailShot offers easy one-hand operation.

**Why we like it:**
- Simple pump action
- Can filter directly into any container
- Pre-filter helps with murky water
- Durable construction

**Considerations:**
- Heavier than squeeze/straw filters
- More moving parts
- Higher price point

**Best for:** Users who dislike squeezing, filtering into containers

## Budget vs. Midrange vs. Premium

| Tier | Example | Price Range | Best For |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|
| Budget | Sawyer Mini | $15-25 | Backup, car kits, tight budgets |
| Midrange | Sawyer Squeeze, LifeStraw | $25-40 | Primary BOB use, best value |
| Premium | Katadyn Pocket | $300+ | Expedition use, extreme durability |

**Our take:** Midrange filters offer the best value for BOB use. Premium filters are overbuilt for most preparedness scenarios.

## Filters vs. Purifiers: What's the Difference?

- **Filters** remove bacteria and protozoa but NOT viruses
- **Purifiers** remove bacteria, protozoa, AND viruses

For North American water sources, filters are sufficient. Viruses are rarely a concern except in areas with human sewage contamination.

**If you want virus protection:** Add purification tablets as backup, or choose a filter/purifier combo like the MSR Guardian.

## Our Recommendation

**For most bug out bags:** Get the **Sawyer Squeeze**. It offers the best combination of filtration quality, versatility, weight, and lifespan.

**On a tight budget:** The **Sawyer Mini** provides excellent filtration for around $20.

**For simplicity:** The **LifeStraw Personal** can't be beat for ease of use.

**Always:** Carry purification tablets as backup. Filters can clog or freeze—tablets are foolproof insurance.

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How long do water filters last?",
      answer: "It varies by model. The Sawyer Squeeze and Mini are rated for 100,000 gallons—effectively a lifetime. The LifeStraw Personal lasts about 1,000 gallons. Check your specific filter's rating."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I filter salt water?",
      answer: "No. Standard filters do not remove salt (dissolved minerals). Desalination requires specialized equipment. For BOB purposes, focus on freshwater sources."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I also carry purification tablets?",
      answer: "Yes. We recommend carrying tablets as backup regardless of your filter. They weigh almost nothing and work when filters fail (clogged, frozen, damaged)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can water filters freeze?",
      answer: "Yes, and freezing can damage the filter membrane. In winter, keep your filter close to your body or in a sleeping bag to prevent freezing."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a water filter if I'm only preparing for 72 hours?",
      answer: "You could carry 3 days of water instead, but it's heavy (24+ lbs). A filter lets you carry less water and resupply as needed—much more practical."
