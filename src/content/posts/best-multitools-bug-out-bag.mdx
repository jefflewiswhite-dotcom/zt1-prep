# Best Multitools for Bug Out Bags (Top 10)

A quality multitool is one of the most versatile items in your [bug out bag](/guides/bug-out-bag). It handles cutting, repairs, food prep, medical tasks, and countless unexpected needs—all in one compact package.

Here are our top picks for BOB multitools.

## Quick Picks

| Rank | Product | Best For | Tools | Weight | Price Range |
|------|---------|----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Leatherman Wave+ | Overall | 18 | 8.5 oz | $$$ |
| 2 | Leatherman Wingman | Value | 14 | 7 oz | $$ |
| 3 | Victorinox SwissTool | Build Quality | 27 | 10 oz | $$$ |
| 4 | Gerber Suspension NXT | Budget | 15 | 9 oz | $ |
| 5 | Victorinox Huntsman | Lightweight | 15 | 3.5 oz | $$ |

## What Makes a Good BOB Multitool?

**Essential tools:**
- Pliers (needle-nose preferred)
- Wire cutters
- Knife blade (plain edge most versatile)
- Screwdrivers (Phillips and flat)
- Can/bottle opener
- File

**Nice to have:**
- Scissors
- Saw (wood)
- Awl
- Wire stripper

**Build quality matters:** A multitool that breaks or malfunctions is worse than no tool at all. Stick with reputable brands.

<Callout type="info">
The best multitool is the one you'll actually carry. A heavy, bulky tool left at home is useless. Consider weight and size alongside features.

## Detailed Reviews

### 1. Leatherman Wave+ — Best Overall

<ProductCard slug="leatherman-wave-plus" badge="Top Pick" variant="featured" />

The Wave+ is the multitool most often recommended by experienced preppers. It offers the right combination of tools, build quality, and usability.

**Why it wins:**

**Why we like it:**
- 14 useful tools
- Spring-loaded pliers (easier one-hand use)

**Why we like it:**
- 27 tools

**Why we like it:**
- 15 tools
- Spring-loaded pliers
- Open frame design
- Very affordable (~$30-40)

<ProductCard slug="victorinox-swiss-army-huntsman" />

The classic Swiss Army knife with the tool selection BOB users need—including a wood saw.

**Why we like it:**
- Only 3.5 oz (half a Wave's weight)
- Wood saw is excellent
- Scissors are genuinely useful
- Proven for 100+ years
- Fits in pocket easily

**Considerations:**
- No pliers (major limitation)
- Smaller blades
- Non-locking blades (safety concern)

**Best for:** Supplement to dedicated pliers, ultralight builds, [get home bags](/guides/get-home-bag)

## Multitool vs. Fixed Blade Knife

Many preppers debate whether to carry a multitool, fixed blade knife, or both.

| Task | Multitool | Fixed Blade |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Cutting rope | Good | Excellent |
| Food prep | Good | Excellent |
| Batoning wood | Poor | Good |
| Repairs | Excellent | Poor |
| Wire cutting | Good-Excellent | None |
| General utility | Excellent | Limited |

**Our recommendation:** For most BOBs, a quality multitool handles 90% of needs. Add a fixed blade only if you expect heavy cutting/wood processing.

## Our Recommendations

### For Most Bug Out Bags
**Leatherman Wave+** — The gold standard. Yes, it costs more, but the quality, warranty, and tool selection justify the investment.

### On a Budget
**Leatherman Wingman** — Real Leatherman quality at a more accessible price. Does 90% of what the Wave does.

### For Ultralight Builds
**Victorinox Huntsman** plus separate compact pliers — Saves significant weight while covering core needs.

### For Get Home Bags
**Victorinox Huntsman or Leatherman Squirt** — Lighter tools for lighter bags. You don't need full-size pliers to get home.

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Is a multitool enough, or do I need a separate knife?",
      answer: "For most emergency scenarios, a multitool is sufficient. If you expect heavy cutting tasks (processing firewood, building shelter from scratch), a fixed blade is more capable. Many people carry both—multitool for utility, fixed blade for serious cutting."
    },
    {
      question: "Leatherman vs. Victorinox—which is better?",
      answer: "Both make excellent tools. Leatherman tends to have better pliers and is more repair-focused. Victorinox has excellent knives and scissors. For BOB use, Leatherman's pliers usually win out."
    },
    {
      question: "Are cheap multitools worth buying?",
      answer: "For occasional light use, budget tools work. For emergency preparedness where failure matters, invest in Leatherman, Victorinox, or SOG. A broken tool when you need it is worse than no tool."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I maintain my multitool?",
      answer: "Keep it clean and lightly oiled. Work the hinges periodically. Clean and dry it after wet use. Sharpen blades as needed. A well-maintained Leatherman can last decades."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I fly with a multitool?",
      answer: "Not in carry-on luggage (TSA will confiscate it). Pack multitools in checked baggage only. For travel, consider a bladeless tool like the Leatherman Style PS."
