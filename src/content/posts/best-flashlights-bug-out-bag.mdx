# Best Flashlights for Bug Out Bags (Top 10)

When the lights go out, a reliable flashlight transforms a stressful situation into a manageable one. For your [bug out bag](/guides/bug-out-bag), you need a light that's durable, bright enough for navigation, and has reasonable battery life.

Here are our top picks for BOB flashlights.

## Quick Picks

| Rank | Product | Best For | Lumens | Battery | Why We Like It |
|------|---------|----------|--------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Streamlight ProTac 2L-X | Overall | 500 | CR123A | Durability, reliability, professional grade |
| 2 | ThruNite TC15 | Rechargeable | 2,300 | 18650 USB | High output, USB charging, great value |
| 3 | Fenix PD35 V3.0 | Tactical | 1,700 | 18650 | Premium quality, multiple modes |
| 4 | Olight Warrior Mini 2 | EDC/BOB | 1,750 | Proprietary | Compact, magnetic charging |
| 5 | Coast HP7R | Budget | 300 | AA | Affordable, uses common batteries |

## What Makes a Good BOB Flashlight?

For emergency use, prioritize:

**Durability** — Your light may get dropped, crushed, or soaked. It needs to survive.

**Battery availability** — CR123A or AA batteries are available everywhere. 18650s offer better performance but require planning.

**Brightness** — 200-500 lumens handles most needs. More is nice but drains batteries faster.

**Reliability** — Name-brand lights with quality switches and seals. Your life may depend on it.

**Runtime** — Look for low/medium modes that extend battery life for extended use.

<Callout type="info">
Lumens measure total light output, not how far light travels. A 500-lumen light with good focus can outperform a 1,000-lumen light with wide flood.

## Battery Type Guide

| Battery | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| AA | Available everywhere, cheap | Lower output, heavier | Budget builds, backup |
| CR123A | Compact, good power density | Less common, more expensive | Primary tactical lights |
| 18650 | High capacity, rechargeable | Require planning, specialty | High-output primary lights |
| Built-in rechargeable | Convenient | Can't swap batteries | EDC use, regular charging |

**Our recommendation:** CR123A or 18650 for your primary BOB light. Keep a cheap AA light as backup.

## Flashlight vs. Headlamp

Consider whether a flashlight or [headlamp](/gear/best-headlamps-emergencies) better suits your needs:

| Use Case | Flashlight | Headlamp |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Searching/spotting | Better | Adequate |
| Hands-free work | Requires holding | Better |
| Walking/navigation | Good | Better |
| Signaling | Better | Adequate |
| Reading/close work | Adequate | Better |

**Many BOB builders include both:** A flashlight for power and focused light, a headlamp for hands-free use.

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How many lumens do I actually need?",
      answer: "For most BOB use, 200-500 lumens is plenty. Higher lumens drain batteries faster. Prioritize reliability and battery life over maximum brightness."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I get a rechargeable flashlight?",
      answer: "Rechargeable is convenient for everyday use, but for emergency preparedness, having spare batteries you can stockpile is valuable. Ideally, get a light that's rechargeable but can also use replaceable batteries."
    },
    {
      question: "How many extra batteries should I pack?",
      answer: "At minimum, one full reload (2 CR123As or 1 18650). For extended preparedness, 2-3 reloads. Rotate batteries yearly."
    },
    {
      question: "Are cheap flashlights from Amazon okay?",
      answer: "Sometimes. Unknown brands often lie about specifications and may fail when you need them. Stick with established brands (Streamlight, Fenix, ThruNite, Olight, Coast) for reliability."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the color of light matter?",
      answer: "Standard white/cool white is fine for most use. Some lights offer red mode which preserves night vision—nice to have but not essential."
    }
