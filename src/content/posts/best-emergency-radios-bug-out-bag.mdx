# Best Emergency Radios for Bug Out Bags (Top 10)

In a crisis, information is survival. When cell towers are down and internet is unavailable, a weather/emergency radio connects you to NOAA weather alerts, emergency broadcasts, and critical updates. It's one of the most practical items in your [bug out bag](/guides/bug-out-bag).

Here are our top picks for BOB emergency radios.

## Quick Picks

| Rank | Product | Best For | Power Sources | Weight | Price Range |
|------|---------|----------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Midland ER310 | Overall | Crank, Solar, USB, AA | 1.1 lb | $$ |
| 2 | Eton FRX3+ | Features | Crank, Solar, USB | 1 lb | $$ |
| 3 | RunningSnail MD-090P | Budget | Crank, Solar, USB, AAA | 0.7 lb | $ |
| 4 | Sangean MMR-88 | Audio Quality | Crank, USB | 0.9 lb | $$$ |
| 5 | Kaito KA500 | Maximum Features | Crank, Solar, USB, AA, AC | 1.3 lb | $$ |

## What Makes a Good Emergency Radio?

For bug out and preparedness use, prioritize:

**Multiple power sources** — Hand crank, solar, batteries, and USB charging provide redundancy. You can't count on any single power source in an emergency.

**NOAA Weather Band** — Access to all 7 NOAA weather channels with SAME (Specific Area Message Encoding) alerts.

**AM/FM reception** — Local news and information during regional emergencies.

**Durability** — Your radio may get dropped, wet, or dusty. Build quality matters.

**Phone charging** — Many emergency radios can charge phones via USB—useful when every percent of battery matters.

<Callout type="info">
NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts continuously from 1,000+ transmitters nationwide. Even in remote areas, you can usually receive weather and emergency alerts. It's the backbone of emergency communication in the US.

## Power Source Comparison

| Power Source | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|--------------|------|------|----------|
| Hand Crank | Always available | Tiring, slow charge | Emergency backup |
| Solar | Free energy | Slow, needs sun | Supplement charging |
| USB Rechargeable | Fast charge | Needs power source | Pre-emergency prep |
| AA/AAA Batteries | Instant power | Consumable, weight | Reliable backup |

**Our recommendation:** Choose a radio with at least three power options. USB for pre-charging, hand crank for emergencies, and AA batteries for reliable backup.

<Callout type="tip">
Test your hand crank charging. Most radios require 3-5 minutes of cranking for 10-15 minutes of radio time. It's more effort than you think—but knowing how it works matters when you need it.

## Emergency Radio vs. Two-Way Radio

| Feature | Emergency Radio | Two-Way Radio (FRS/GMRS) |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Receive broadcasts | Yes | No |
| Send messages | No | Yes |
| Weather alerts | Yes | Some models |
| Talk to others | No | Yes |
| License required | No | GMRS requires license |
| Best use | Information gathering | Group communication |

**Our recommendation:** For BOB use, start with an emergency radio for receiving information. Add two-way radios if you need group communication. They serve different purposes.

## Our Recommendations

### For Most Bug Out Bags
**Midland ER310** — Best balance of features, reliability, and value. The four power sources ensure you can always get information.

### On a Budget
**RunningSnail MD-090P** — Core functionality at minimal cost. Good enough for emergency use, and the price allows you to put one in multiple locations.

### For Home Emergency Station
**Eton FRX3+ or Kaito KA500** — More features than you need in a BOB, but ideal for home use where weight and size don't matter.

### For Get Home Bags
Consider whether you need a radio. Your phone may be sufficient for shorter scenarios. If you want one, the RunningSnail's compact size and low weight make sense.

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can emergency radios replace my phone?",
      answer: "For information, partially. Radios receive broadcasts but can't access internet, GPS, or send messages. They're a backup when cell networks are down, not a phone replacement."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does hand-crank charging last?",
      answer: "Typically 3-5 minutes of cranking provides 10-15 minutes of radio time (varies by model). It's more effort than you'd expect, but it works when nothing else does."
    },
    {
      question: "What is SAME and why does it matter?",
      answer: "SAME (Specific Area Message Encoding) automatically alerts you to emergencies in your specific area. Instead of listening constantly, the radio activates only when there's a local warning. Very useful feature."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I get a shortwave radio?",
      answer: "For most preparedness, no. NOAA and AM/FM cover domestic emergencies. Shortwave is useful for international news or if you're a radio enthusiast, but it's not essential for typical BOB use."
    },
    {
      question: "Will solar charging keep my radio powered?",
      answer: "Solar helps extend battery life but is too slow to be your only source. Think of it as a supplement—leave the radio in the sun to top off, but don't rely on it as primary charging."
