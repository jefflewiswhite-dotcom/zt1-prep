# Emergency Bivvy vs Sleeping Bag: Which Should You Pack?

Your sleep system is critical survival gear—exposure kills more people in emergencies than almost anything else. But weight matters in a [bug out bag](/guides/bug-out-bag), so choosing the right shelter solution requires balancing warmth, weight, and packability.

Let's break down when to choose an emergency bivvy versus a sleeping bag.

## Quick Answer

**Choose an emergency bivvy if:** Weight is critical, you need maximum packability, or you're building a [get home bag](/guides/get-home-bag) or ultralight BOB.

**Choose a sleeping bag if:** You prioritize comfort, expect colder temperatures, or have a vehicle-based kit where weight matters less.

**Best of both worlds:** Pack an emergency bivvy as a backup/supplement to a lightweight sleeping bag.

## When to Choose an Emergency Bivvy

An emergency bivvy is essentially a body-shaped bag made of reflective material (similar to emergency blankets but more durable and reusable). It works by reflecting your body heat back to you.

<ProductCard slug="sol-emergency-bivvy" badge="Best Bivvy" />

**Best for:**

- **Get home bags** where minimum weight is essential
- **Ultralight bug out bags** prioritizing mobility
- **Backup shelter** in addition to other sleep systems
- **Car emergency kits** where space is limited
- **Warm climate emergencies** where hypothermia risk is lower

**Pros:**
- Extremely lightweight (3-8 oz)
- Packs smaller than a soda can
- Reflects 90% of body heat
- Waterproof exterior
- Bright colors for signaling
- Affordable ($10-40)

**Cons:**
- Condensation builds inside (can make you damp)
- Not comfortable for extended use
- Less effective in extreme cold
- Noisy/crinkly material
- Limited durability (1-5 uses typically)

<Callout type="tip">
Look for "bivvy" not "blanket." Emergency blankets tear easily and aren't reusable. Bivvies have reinforced seams and are designed for multiple uses.

## When to Choose a Sleeping Bag

Sleeping bags use insulation (down or synthetic) to trap air and create warmth. They're rated for specific temperatures and provide genuine comfort.

<ProductCard slug="teton-sports-celsius" badge="Best Value Bag" />

**Best for:**

- **Home-based 72-hour kits** where weight doesn't matter
- **Vehicle emergency kits** with storage space
- **Cold climate preparedness** where hypothermia is a real risk
- **Bug out bags when you can handle the weight**
- **Dual-use** (emergencies + camping/outdoor recreation)

**Pros:**
- Genuine warmth with temperature ratings
- Comfortable enough to actually sleep
- Breathable materials reduce condensation
- Durable with years of use
- Multiple insulation and temperature options

**Cons:**
- Heavy (2-5+ lbs)
- Bulky packed size
- More expensive
- Requires protection from moisture
- Takes up significant pack space

## Decision Tree: Which Is Right for You?

```
START: What's your primary kit?
│
├─ Get Home Bag → Emergency Bivvy
│
├─ Bug Out Bag
│   │
│   ├─ Weight limit under 20 lbs? → Emergency Bivvy (+ consider bag upgrade later)
│   │
│   ├─ Cold climate (winter nights below 40°F)? → Sleeping Bag
│   │
│   └─ Moderate climate, balanced approach? → Both (bivvy inside lightweight bag)
│
├─ Car Emergency Kit → Either works (lean toward sleeping bag if space allows)
│
└─ Home 72-Hour Kit → Sleeping Bag (weight doesn't matter)
```

## The Best of Both Worlds

Many experienced preppers carry **both**:

1. **Lightweight sleeping bag** (30-40°F rated, ~2 lbs) as primary
2. **Emergency bivvy** as waterproof outer layer and backup

Using a bivvy *over* a sleeping bag:
- Adds waterproof protection
- Increases warmth by reflecting additional heat
- Provides redundancy if one fails

This combo adds only 4-8 oz to your sleeping bag weight while significantly increasing your temperature range and redundancy.

## Temperature Performance

| Scenario | Emergency Bivvy | Budget Sleeping Bag | Quality Sleeping Bag |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 60°F night | Comfortable | Too warm | Too warm |
| 50°F night | Adequate | Comfortable | Comfortable |
| 40°F night | Survivable | Adequate | Comfortable |
| 30°F night | Dangerous | Cold | Adequate |
| 20°F night | Dangerous | Dangerous | Adequate |

**Key insight:** Bivvies don't *generate* heat—they reflect your body heat. If you're already hypothermic, a bivvy won't save you. If you're generating heat, it helps retain it.

## Our Recommendations

### For Get Home Bags
**Get an emergency bivvy.** Weight and packability trump comfort for a kit designed to get you home in 12-24 hours.

**Our pick:** SOL Emergency Bivvy (~$25)

### For Bug Out Bags (Moderate Climates)
**Get both.** A lightweight sleeping bag (30-40°F) plus an emergency bivvy gives you comfort, warmth range, and redundancy for around 2.5 lbs total.

### For Bug Out Bags (Cold Climates)
**Prioritize a quality sleeping bag.** A bivvy alone won't keep you alive in genuinely cold conditions. Get a bag rated 10-20°F below the coldest temps you expect.

### For Car Kits
**Get a sleeping bag.** You have the space, and waiting for help in a cold vehicle is much more bearable with a real sleeping bag.

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "Can an emergency bivvy keep you warm enough to survive?",
      answer: "In mild conditions (50°F+), yes. In colder conditions, it can mean the difference between dangerous hypothermia and survivable cold, but it won't keep you comfortable. Below freezing, a bivvy alone is inadequate for most people."
    },
    {
      question: "How many times can you reuse an emergency bivvy?",
      answer: "Quality bivvies like the SOL Emergency Bivvy can be reused 3-10+ times with careful use. Emergency blankets (the thin crinkly kind) are typically single-use."
    },
    {
      question: "Does condensation inside a bivvy make you colder?",
      answer: "It can. Moisture conducts heat away from your body faster than dry air. Opening the bivvy periodically to vent moisture helps, as does wearing moisture-wicking base layers."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best ultralight sleeping bag for a BOB?",
      answer: "Budget options include the TETON Sports bags. Ultralight backpacking bags (like Enlightened Equipment quilts) offer better weight-to-warmth ratios but cost $200+. For most BOB uses, a budget bag plus bivvy is adequate."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I pack an emergency blanket too?",
      answer: "If you have a bivvy, you don't need a blanket (bivvies are better). An emergency blanket as additional backup weighs almost nothing, so it doesn't hurt—but the bivvy is your primary."
