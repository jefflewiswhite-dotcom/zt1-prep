      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <p>
        We believe everyone should be prepared for life's unexpected moments—not out of fear, but from a place of confidence and common sense. Our goal is to help you take that first step from unprepared to ready.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's what "Zero to One" means: going from nothing to something. Not building a bunker or stockpiling for the apocalypse, but having the basics covered so you can handle power outages, severe weather, unexpected evacuations, and everyday emergencies.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Cover</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bug out bags</strong> — Mobile emergency kits for when you need to leave quickly</li>
        <li><strong>Get home bags</strong> — Compact kits for getting home when the unexpected happens</li>
        <li><strong>Water preparedness</strong> — Storage, purification, and portable filtration</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency power</strong> — Backup power for grid-down situations</li>
        <li><strong>Food storage</strong> — Building a practical emergency food supply</li>
        <li><strong>Home emergency kits</strong> — What to have when sheltering in place</li>
        <li><strong>Vehicle preparedness</strong> — Car kits for roadside emergencies and more</li>
        <li><strong>Skills & planning</strong> — The knowledge that makes gear useful</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>

      <p>
        We're not about fear-mongering or doomsday scenarios. We focus on practical, achievable preparedness for the emergencies that actually happen—storms, power outages, job loss, natural disasters, and unexpected disruptions to daily life.
