      <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>

      <p class="lead text-xl text-stone-600">
        ZT1 Prep is reader-supported. We believe in full transparency about how we make money and how it affects our recommendations.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Make Money</h2>

      <p>
        ZT1 Prep earns money through <strong>affiliate marketing</strong>. When you click certain links on our site and make a purchase, we may earn a commission. This happens at no extra cost to you—you pay the same price whether you use our link or go directly to the retailer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our primary affiliate relationship is with <strong>Amazon Associates</strong>. We may also have relationships with other retailers and brands.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Means for Our Recommendations</h2>

      <p>
        Here's our commitment to you:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>We only recommend products we believe provide value.</strong> If we wouldn't use it or recommend it to family, we don't recommend it to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Affiliate relationships never determine our ratings.</strong> A product with a higher commission doesn't get a higher rating.</li>
        <li><strong>We include non-affiliate options when they're best.</strong> If the best choice doesn't have an affiliate program, we still recommend it.</li>
        <li><strong>Our opinions are our own.</strong> Brands don't pay for positive coverage or control our content.</li>
        <li><strong>We update content when products change.</strong> If a recommended product's quality drops, we update our recommendation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Choose Products</h2>

      <p>
        Our recommendation process:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Research</strong> — We study specifications, user reviews, expert opinions, and community feedback</li>
        <li><strong>Compare</strong> — We analyze products across categories based on performance, value, and reliability</li>
        <li><strong>Recommend</strong> — We suggest the best options for different needs and budgets</li>
        <li><strong>Update</strong> — We regularly revisit recommendations as products and markets change</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Note: We haven't personally tested every product we recommend. When we have hands-on experience, we note it. When recommendations are based on research, we're transparent about that too.
      </p>

      <h2>Identifying Affiliate Links</h2>

      <p>
        Pages with affiliate links include a disclosure notice near the top. Individual product links may have affiliate tracking parameters in the URL.
      </p>

      <p>
        Common indicators of affiliate links:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Amazon links with "tag=" parameters</li>
        <li>Links through affiliate networks</li>
        <li>"Check Price" or "Buy on Amazon" buttons</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you prefer not to use affiliate links, you can search for products directly on retailer websites. We won't earn a commission, but you'll get the same prices and products.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Use Affiliate Marketing</h2>

      <p>
        Creating quality content takes time and resources. Affiliate commissions allow us to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Keep our content free and accessible</li>
        <li>Continue creating helpful guides and reviews</li>
        <li>Maintain and update the site</li>
        <li>Research new products and topics</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We chose affiliate marketing because it aligns our incentives with yours: we do well when we help you find products that meet your needs. Unlike advertising models, we don't get paid just for eyeballs—we only earn when you actually buy something useful.
      </p>

      <h2>Amazon Associates Disclosure</h2>

      <p>
        ZT1 Prep is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases.
      </p>

      <h2>FTC Compliance</h2>

      <p>
        This disclosure is provided in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."
      </p>

      <h2>Questions?</h2>
